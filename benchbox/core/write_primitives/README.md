# Write Primitives Benchmark

## Overview

The Write Primitives benchmark tests **fundamental write operations** for OLAP databases using the TPC-H schema as foundation. This benchmark provides comprehensive testing of insert, update, delete, bulk load, merge/upsert, DDL, and transaction operations.

**Purpose**: Replace the legacy `merge` benchmark with a comprehensive write operation testing suite that measures:
- Write throughput (rows/second)
- Operation latency and overhead
- Data format efficiency (CSV, Parquet, compressed variants)
- Transaction and isolation level performance
- DDL operation costs
- Data validation and consistency

## Design Philosophy

Following the **primitives benchmark pattern**, this benchmark:
- Uses YAML catalog for operation definitions (`catalog/operations.yaml`)
- Reuses TPC-H data via `get_data_source_benchmark() -> "tpch"`
- Pairs every write operation with validation read queries
- Provides single-sentence descriptions for each operation
- Supports platform-specific SQL variants via SQLGlot
- Measures end-to-end write-read cycle performance

## Benchmark Statistics

- **Total Operations**: 136 (112 baseline + 24 sketch — TRANSACTION ops moved to transaction_primitives)
- **Categories**: 7 (INSERT 12, UPDATE 15, DELETE 14, BULK_LOAD 36, MERGE 23, DDL 12, SKETCH 24)
- **Data Formats**: CSV, Parquet (uncompressed, gzip, zstd, snappy, bzip2)
- **Scale Factors**: Flexible (0.01 to 10.0+)
- **Platform Support**: All platforms via dialect translation + platform-specific overrides
- **Status**: ✅ All operations fully implemented and tested

## Operation Categories

### 1. INSERT Operations (12 operations)

Tests various insert patterns from single row to complex joins:
- Single row INSERT
- Batch INSERT (10, 100, 1000 rows)
- INSERT...SELECT (simple, with JOIN, aggregated, from multiple tables)
- INSERT...UNION
- INSERT with default values
- INSERT...ON CONFLICT (UPSERT)
- INSERT...RETURNING

### 2. UPDATE Operations (15 operations)

Tests selective and bulk updates with various predicates:
- Single row by primary key
- Selective (10%, 50%, 100% of rows)
- With subquery, JOIN, aggregate
- Multi-column updates (5+ columns)
- With CASE expression, computed columns
- String manipulation, date arithmetic
- Conditional updates
- UPDATE...RETURNING

### 3. DELETE Operations (12 operations)

Tests deletion patterns from single row to bulk deletes:
- Single row by primary key
- Selective (10%, 25%, 50%, 75% of rows)
- With subquery, JOIN, aggregation
- With NOT EXISTS (anti-join)
- DELETE...RETURNING
- Cascade simulation
- DELETE vs TRUNCATE comparison

### 4. BULK_LOAD Operations (36 operations)

Tests bulk loading from files with various formats and compression:
- CSV loads (12): uncompressed, gzip, zstd, bzip2 × (1K, 100K, 1M rows)
- Parquet loads (12): uncompressed, snappy, gzip, zstd × (1K, 100K, 1M rows)
- Special loads (12): column subset, transformations, error handling, parallel, upsert, append vs replace modes, custom delimiters, NULL handling, custom date formats

### 5. MERGE Operations (23 operations)

Tests MERGE/UPSERT patterns including INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE:
- Simple UPSERT
- UPSERT with DELETE clause (tri-directional)
- Varying overlap scenarios (10%, 50%, 90%, none, all)
- Multi-column join conditions
- Aggregated source queries
- Conditional UPDATE and INSERT
- Multi-column updates
- Computed values, string operations, date arithmetic
- CTE sources
- MERGE...RETURNING
- Error handling (duplicate sources)
- SCD Type 2 dimension maintenance — three ops that exercise history-retaining
  merges via portable UPDATE-then-INSERT, keyed on a business key:
  - `merge_scd_type2_basic` — canonical close-old-plus-insert-new for changed
    and new keys
  - `merge_scd_type2_no_change` — idempotency check: an unchanged batch closes
    no rows and inserts no new versions
  - `merge_scd_type2_new_keys_only` — insert-only path where every staged key is
    brand-new, so no existing rows are closed

### 6. DDL Operations (12 operations)

Tests schema evolution and table management:
- CREATE TABLE (simple, with constraints, with indexes)
- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT (simple, aggregated)
- ALTER TABLE (ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN, RENAME COLUMN)
- CREATE INDEX (on empty table, on existing data)
- DROP INDEX
- CREATE VIEW
- DROP TABLE
- TRUNCATE TABLE (small, large datasets)

### 7. TRANSACTION Operations (8 operations)

Tests transaction control and isolation levels:
- COMMIT (small/10 writes, medium/100 writes, large/1000 writes)
- ROLLBACK (small/3 writes, medium/100 writes)
- Nested SAVEPOINTs with partial rollback
- Isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE)

### Sketch persistence operations (24 operations)

Tests the **persist + merge + requery** lifecycle for Apache DataSketches
sketch artifacts — the differentiated half of the modern approximate-
analytics story (vendors compete on millisecond-merge across partitioned
sketch columns, not on one-shot aggregate latency).

**Core lifecycle (8 ops)** — Theta / KLL / Top-K families at default parameters:

- `sketch_ddl_create_persistent_table` — CREATE/DROP overhead for a
  BINARY-column persistence table
- `sketch_insert_theta_per_partition` — build per-partition Theta sketches
- `sketch_insert_kll_per_partition` — build per-partition KLL quantile sketches
- `sketch_insert_topk_per_shard` — build per-shard frequent-items sketches
- ★ `sketch_query_theta_union_merge` — merge thetas across partitions and
  emit an approximate distinct count (cross-reference `aggregation_distinct`
  in read_primitives for the exact baseline)
- ★ `sketch_query_kll_quantiles_merge` — merge KLLs and extract a median
  (cross-reference `statistical_percentiles` in read_primitives)
- ★ `sketch_query_topk_combine` — combine frequent-items sketches across
  shards and count the merged frequent items (cross-reference
  `approx_top_k_lineitem` in read_primitives)
- `sketch_drop_persistent_table` — DROP overhead for a sketch-bearing table

**Accuracy/size parameter sweeps (6 ops)** — same merge lifecycle at smaller
and larger sketch sizes to expose the accuracy-vs-storage trade-off:

- `sketch_query_theta_union_merge_lgk10` / `_lgk14` — Theta at lg_k=10
  (~5KB, ~3.1% RSE) and lg_k=14 (~64KB, ~0.8% RSE)
- `sketch_query_kll_quantiles_merge_k100` / `_k1000` — KLL at k=100
  (~1.5KB, ~1.65% rank error) and k=1000 (~15KB, ~0.59% rank error)
- `sketch_query_topk_combine_lgmm8` / `_lgmm10` — Top-K at lg_max_map_size=8
  (256 buckets, ~600B) and lg_max_map_size=10 (1024 buckets, ~2KB)

**Extended DuckDB-only families (8 ops)** — CPC (distinct) and REQ (quantile)
sketches available through the `datasketches` community extension:

- `sketch_cpc_create_persistent_table` / `sketch_cpc_insert_per_partition` /
  ★ `sketch_cpc_query_union_merge` / `sketch_cpc_drop_persistent_table` —
  CPC distinct-count lifecycle (union-merge + approximate distinct)
- `sketch_req_create_persistent_table` / `sketch_req_insert_per_partition` /
  ★ `sketch_req_query_quantile_merge` / `sketch_req_drop_persistent_table` —
  REQ quantile lifecycle (merge + median extraction)

**PySpark DataFrame headlines (2 ops)** — exercise the persist+merge cycle
through the DataFrame API rather than SQL:

- ★ `sketch_df_hll_persist_merge` — per-group HLL sketches, persist + merge
- ★ `sketch_df_topk_persist_merge` — per-group Top-K, persist + merge
  (Spark 4.1+ only — uses `F.approx_top_k`)

The ★ ops are the **headline tests** that validate the "millisecond merge"
claim. Validation contracts use tolerance-based `expected_value_min/max`
because sketch outputs are non-deterministic across engines and runs.

| Sketch family   | DataSketches binary-portable engines              | Native-but-distinct engines                    | No support       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Theta (distinct)| Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery (HLL), DuckDB ext | ClickHouse (-State combinators)               | DataFusion       |
| KLL (quantile)  | Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, DuckDB ext       | ClickHouse (quantileTDigestState)             | Redshift, DataFusion |
| Top-K (frequent)| Databricks, Snowflake, DuckDB ext                 | ClickHouse (topKState), Redshift (HLL only)   | BigQuery, DataFusion |

Per-engine column-type mapping for sketch storage:

| Engine     | Type alias |
|------------|------------|
| Databricks | `BINARY`   |
| Snowflake  | `BINARY`   |
| BigQuery   | `BYTES`    |
| DuckDB     | `BLOB` (with `datasketches` community extension)|
| ClickHouse | `String` (or `AggregateFunction(...)` natively) |
| Redshift   | `HLLSKETCH` (HLL family only) |

DataSketches binary format is portable across Databricks / Snowflake /
BigQuery / DuckDB-with-extension (all share the C++/Java/WASM core).
ClickHouse uses its own `-State`/`-Merge` combinator serialization;
ClickHouse-native variants are deferred to a follow-up.

## Schema Design

### Base Tables (from TPC-H)
- **REGION**, **NATION**, **CUSTOMER**, **SUPPLIER**, **PART**, **PARTSUPP**, **ORDERS**, **LINEITEM**

### Staging Tables
- **orders_stage** - Copy of ORDERS for UPDATE/DELETE testing
- **lineitem_stage** - Copy of LINEITEM for write testing
- **orders_new** - Source for MERGE testing (50% overlap)
- **orders_summary** - Target for aggregated INSERT...SELECT
- **lineitem_enriched** - Target for joined INSERT...SELECT

### Metadata Tables
- **write_ops_log** - Audit log for all write operations
- **batch_metadata** - Tracks batch operations with file info

## Data Generation

The benchmark reuses TPC-H data through `get_data_source_benchmark() -> "tpch"` and generates:
- Staging tables (10% of ORDERS, 5% of LINEITEM)
- Bulk load files in `_project/write_primitives_files/{scale_factor}/`
- CSV files: uncompressed, gzip, zstd (1K, 100K, 1M rows)
- Parquet files: uncompressed, snappy, zstd (1K, 100K, 1M rows)

## Usage Examples

```python
from benchbox.write_primitives import WritePrimitivesBenchmark

# Initialize and generate data
bench = WritePrimitivesBenchmark(scale_factor=1.0)
bench.generate_data()

# Run single operation
result = bench.execute_operation("insert_single_row", connection)

# Run category
results = bench.run_category("insert", connection, iterations=3)

# Run full benchmark
results = bench.run_benchmark(connection, iterations=3)
```

## Performance Metrics

Each operation captures:
- **Write Metrics**: duration, rows affected, throughput
- **Validation Metrics**: validation duration, passed/failed status
- **Combined Metrics**: end-to-end duration and throughput

## Platform Compatibility

Operations use SQLGlot dialect translation by default, with `platform_overrides` in
`catalog/operations.yaml` for platform-specific SQL or explicit skips (`null`). When
a platform override is `null`, `_get_effective_write_sql()` returns a skip reason and
the operation is recorded as `SKIPPED` in results.

### DataFusion (v51.0.0) - 64 Skipped Operations

DataFusion is an Arrow-native query engine that operates on **immutable record batches**.
This architecture provides excellent read/scan performance but means row-level mutation
(UPDATE, DELETE) is not implemented - there is no write path for existing data. MERGE
depends on UPDATE/DELETE and is therefore also unsupported.

All 64 skips fall into categories dictated by this architectural constraint. None have
viable alternative SQL syntax within DataFusion's current capability set.

#### UPDATE - 15 operations (queries 13-27)

`NotImplemented("Unsupported logical plan: Dml(Update)")`

Row-level mutation is architecturally impossible on immutable Arrow record batches. A
CTAS-based workaround would measure fundamentally different performance (full table
rewrite vs. in-place update) and is therefore not substituted.

#### DELETE - 14 operations (queries 28-39, 94-95)

`NotImplemented("Unsupported logical plan: Dml(Delete)")`

Same architectural constraint as UPDATE. Includes the 2 GDPR-pattern deletes
(queries 94-95) which also require DELETE.

#### MERGE - 23 operations (queries 76-93, 96-100)

`NotImplemented("Unsupported SQL statement: MERGE INTO...")`

MERGE requires UPDATE and/or DELETE capabilities, neither of which DataFusion supports.
Covers all upsert patterns, conditional update/insert, ETL aggregation, and deduplication.
Includes the 3 SCD Type 2 ops (queries 98-100: `merge_scd_type2_basic`,
`merge_scd_type2_no_change`, `merge_scd_type2_new_keys_only`), which depend on
UPDATE/INSERT against existing rows and carry explicit `datafusion: null` overrides.

#### DDL Mutations - 8 operations

| Operation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `ddl_truncate_table_small` | `NotImplemented("Unsupported SQL statement: TRUNCATE TABLE")` |
| `ddl_create_table_with_constraints` | PK/FK constraints parse but are not enforced; benchmark would test no-op behavior |
| `ddl_create_table_with_index` | `NotImplemented("Unsupported logical plan: CreateIndex")` |
| `ddl_alter_table_add_column` | `NotImplemented("Unsupported SQL statement: ALTER TABLE")` |
| `ddl_alter_table_drop_column` | No ALTER TABLE support |
| `ddl_alter_table_rename_column` | No ALTER TABLE support |
| `ddl_create_index_on_existing` | No indexing support |
| `ddl_drop_index` | No indexing support |

#### INSERT Edge Cases - 2 operations

| Operation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `insert_on_conflict_ignore` | `Plan("Insert-on clause not supported")` - no constraint enforcement makes ON CONFLICT meaningless |
| `insert_returning_clause` | `Plan("Insert-returning clause not supported")` |

#### BULK_LOAD Edge Cases - 2 operations

| Operation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `bulk_load_error_handling_skip_bad_rows` | DataFusion's CSV reader has no `IGNORE_ERRORS` equivalent; all rows must be valid |
| `bulk_load_upsert_mode` | Requires MERGE INTO, which is unsupported |

#### Upstream Tracking

If DataFusion adds DML support in a future version
([apache/datafusion#1885](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/1885)), these
skips should be revisited and the `datafusion: null` overrides removed for any newly
supported operations.
