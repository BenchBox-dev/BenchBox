# UAT Framework — Design Document

> **Status:** implemented; maintained as the UAT framework design contract.
> **Source TODO:** `_project/TODO/main/planning/uat-framework-tests-uat-runner.yaml`

> **Sibling spec (consumed, not duplicated):** `_project/specs/uat-methodology-blind-spot-remediation.md`
> **Author inputs:**
>   - retired stress-test shell workflow (superseded by `make uat-stress`)
>   - `_project/handoffs/results-explorer-uat-retrospective-20260502.md` (the bespoke driver this spec replaces)

## 1. Reframe — what this spec is and is not

### 1.1 The drift gap

The retired shell stress workflow and the 2026-05-02 UAT driver were two
parallel surfaces for matrix-shape execution that drifted. The framework
consolidates the reusable pieces:

- timeout/gtimeout/perl-fallback wrappers (lines 90-123, 359-429)
- registry enumeration via `benchbox.core.benchmark_registry`
  (lines 232-263)
- per-platform port maps, `--platform-option` tables, CLI flags, uv
  extras (lines 142-192, 548-555)
- TCP probing with sentinel-file cache (lines 197-227)
- result-JSON path extraction (line 478)

The 2026-05-02 sweep needed all of that plus:

- scale ladder with early-stop (previous-rung failure or wall-clock > 180s)
- reuse-aware database cleanup (preserve `datagen/`, prune `databases/`
  at safe boundaries)
- sentinel file at sweep start for `find -newer` queries
- matrix-summary TSV
- validator-clean-rate roll-up (now in-process via `benchbox.validation.bundle`)
- submission packaging with explicit terminal-state declaration
- explorer build + Playwright smoke

None of the second list was reusable afterwards. It survived only as
artifacts under `~/Developer/benchmark_runs/logs/uat_20260502/` plus
the retrospective prose. The framework makes that machinery reusable
through one typed config/orchestrator path.

### 1.2 Why this is separate from the methodology spec

The methodology spec (`uat-methodology-blind-spot-remediation.md`)
resolves *how UAT TODOs are authored and reviewed*: cross-scale
coverage convention, validator-clean-rate metric, terminal-state
vocab plus `gating: true` open-question schema. Its two
implementation TODOs are now in DONE.

This spec resolves *how UAT machinery is built and reused*. Sibling,
not competitor. The two methodology TODOs ship the inputs this
framework consumes:

- `benchbox.validation.bundle` — invoked in-process by `make uat-validate`
- `submit_terminal_state` four-word vocab — read from YAML by
  `make uat-package`

### 1.3 What this spec covers

A single Python framework under `tests/uat/` (tracked, version-
controlled), exposed via `make uat-*` operator targets, with
composable phases driven by YAML configs under `tests/uat/configs/`.
Stress testing becomes a degenerate config (one scale, one platform
group, no validate/package/explorer phases).

### 1.4 What this spec does not cover

- Cloud-platform UAT (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Athena,
  Databricks, ClickHouse Cloud) — deferred to a separate
  `uat-framework-cloud-platforms` TODO if/when the explorer's cloud
  facets are ready.
- ~~Throughput-phase coverage~~ — **shipped** (`throughput-uat-and-ci-coverage`):
  `tests/uat/throughput.py`, `execute.official`/`execute.streams`/
  `execute.seed`, and a `throughput` segment in `execute.phases_arg` route
  to `benchbox run-official --streams N` (the only CLI surface that honors
  N>1 concurrent streams; see `tests.uat.matrix.benchbox_run_official_argv`).
  Nightly-only in practice — `tests/uat/configs/uat-throughput-duckdb-nightly.yaml`
  run from `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` — because multi-stream cells
  multiply wall-clock cost; not part of the default fast-lane matrix.
- A `benchbox uat` CLI subcommand — UAT is a project-developer
  concern, `benchbox` is a project-user concern. `make` targets are
  the developer entrypoint for `worktree-*`, `blind-spots-*`,
  `pr-*`, `dev-loop-metrics`; UAT joins the same pattern.

**Responsibility split.**

| Module | Responsibility | Lines (est.) | Actual (2026-07-21) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | UAT package marker and documentation string | — | 6 |
| `matrix.py` | Registry-driven benchmark enumeration, platform grouping, compose-derived TCP reachability probe (connection facts now owned by `docker_assets`) | 250 | 539 |
| `runner.py` | Build `benchbox run` argv per cell; capture stdout+stderr to per-run log; extract result-JSON path; submit classification via shared `benchbox.core.results.submit_classification` | 120 | 354 |
| `config.py` | Load YAML, validate against schema (Section 3), expose typed dataclass access | 180 | 843 |

| `docker_cleanup.py` | Docker stack teardown at platform boundaries; project-scoped down/volume handling | — | 426 |
| `container_cleanup.py` | Apple `container`-engine sibling of `docker_cleanup.py`; backs `make uat-docker-cleanup ENGINE=container` | — | 557 |
| `artifact_hygiene.py` | Local-artifact hygiene guard: flags worktree-local `benchmark_runs/` growth whenever the resolved output root is outside the worktree — including the default `../benchmark_runs`, not only a configured one; report-only (`make uat-artifact-hygiene`) | — | 315 |
| `cells_io.py` | `cells.jsonl` + accounting-sidecar read/write codec; single schema shared by `orchestrator.py` and `_cli.py` | — | 481 |

**Budget reconciliation (revised 2026-06-01, `uat-loc-budget-reconciliation`; re-measured
2026-07-19, `uat-config-schema-spec-realignment`).**
Original estimate: ~1,500 LOC across 13 modules. 2026-06-01 measured actual: ~6,476
production LOC across 21 modules (+ ~5,730 test LOC, ~1,729 YAML) — see that
reconciliation's own causes (four unlisted modules, under-estimated phases/plumbing).

**2026-07-19 re-measurement.** Five modules landed since 2026-06-01 —
`artifact_hygiene.py`, `cells_io.py`, `container_cleanup.py`,
`gate_summary.py`, `throughput.py`, all in-charter (artifact
hygiene, gate evidence, and throughput are release-gate-orchestration
deliverables; `cells_io.py`/`container_cleanup.py` are refactors that gave
existing inline logic its own module). The per-module **Actual** column above
and the per-bucket totals below are auto-generated from the tree by
`_project/scripts/uat_loc_table.py` (`uat-spec-module-loc-table-autogen`); CI
runs it with `--check` to keep them from drifting, so refresh both by running
that script after a UAT module changes. Test LOC (~10,806) and YAML (~1,880)
remain hand-tracked.

<!-- UAT-LOC-SUMMARY:BEGIN (generated by _project/scripts/uat_loc_table.py; do not hand-edit) -->

**Per-bucket production LOC** (auto-generated -- run the script to refresh):

- plumbing (orchestrator/config/`_cli`): 2,631
- core exercise (execute/matrix/runner/enumerate/cleanup/ladder): 2,811
- preflight/compat/timeouts: 1,270
- Docker lifecycle (default-OFF, incl. `container_cleanup.py`): 1,871
- chartered evidence artifacts (validate/report/package/cells_io/gate_summary): 1,787
- explorer-prep: 387
- throughput: 316
- artifact hygiene: 315
- package init markers: 23

**Total: 11,411 production LOC across 26 modules.**

<!-- UAT-LOC-SUMMARY:END -->

The chartered scope is "release-gate orchestration" (§10) — evidence
artifacts, the six phases, Docker lifecycle, and throughput are all
in-charter, so the load-bearing buckets remain non-discretionary.

Revised budget: **~9,800 production LOC across ~26 modules + tests**, reviewed
per-bucket above rather than against a single aggregate number.

## 3. YAML config schema

Schema is the source of truth for what a UAT config can express.
Validation lives in `config.py`; each field below is enforced.

```yaml
# tests/uat/configs/<sweep-name>.yaml

# Identity --------------------------------------------------------------
name: "uat-2026-05-02"          # required, str. Used in log dir name.

# Phase composition -----------------------------------------------------
phases:                          # required, list[str]. Order matters.
  - preflight
  - execute
  - validate
  - package
  - explorer_smoke
  - report
# Allowed: preflight, execute, validate, package, explorer_smoke, report.
# Stress preset omits validate/package/explorer_smoke. Entries must be a
# subsequence of that canonical order (the orchestrator walks `phases:`
# literally, not reordered) and must not repeat -- both rejected at load
# time (see "Schema enforcement" below).

dry_run: false                   # optional, bool, default false. When
                                 # true, every phase prints what it
                                 # would do without invoking benchbox.

  override: null                 # optional, float|null. When set, uses
                                 # this single scale per cell (matches
                                 # bash --scale override). Mutually
                                 # exclusive with rungs -- explicitly
                                 # setting both is rejected at load time.
                                 # Rung/override entries must be numbers;

# Disk-budget estimate --------------------------------------------------
# `tests/uat/data/disk_budget_table.tsv` is an advisory, checked-in
# inventory keyed by (platform, benchmark, scale_factor). Preflight
# prints `Disk budget estimate: ... GiB` before workload execution.
# The estimate never gates execution; unknown cells are surfaced as a
# count and `preflight.free_space_min_gib` remains the hard cutoff.

# Resume (retired) -------------------------------------------------------
# The resume manifest (`<log-dir>/resume.json`, `--resume <manifest>`)
# was removed -- see uat-resume-retirement-artifact-durability. It was
# verified fragile (no version/config/commit check on replay, only ever
# written for free-space aborts, unreachable from `make`) and datagen
# reuse already makes a full rerun cheap. The abort-safe artifacts
# (cells.jsonl, compatibility_pruned.jsonl, matrix_summary.partial.tsv)
# stay and are now written atomically -- see "Artifact provenance and
# abort evidence" in docs/operations/uat-framework.md.

# Validate phase --------------------------------------------------------

  validator_clean_rate_floor: 0.80   # optional, float, default 0.80.
                                     # If rate < floor, validate phase
                                     # exit is non-zero (advisory).

# Package phase ---------------------------------------------------------
package:
  submit_terminal_state: "local-stage"   # required when package phase
                                         # enabled. One of:
                                         #   local-stage,

  service: null                          # optional, str|null. Required

# draft-pr/merged-to-published-results are accepted vocabulary (the
# submit_terminal_state validation treats them as valid states) but the
# package phase's PR-opening behavior for them is UNIMPLEMENTED --
# `tests/uat/phases/package.py` dispatches both to the same argv as
# local-stage and prints an operator warning naming the config that any
# result submitted this way is a local stage, not a published-results PR.

# Explorer smoke phase --------------------------------------------------

```

**Schema enforcement.**

| Rule | Effect |
|---|---|
| Unknown field in any section (root or nested) | Validation error at load time |
| `phases:` references unknown phase | Validation error at load time |
| `phases:` contains a duplicate entry | Validation error at load time |
| `phases:` entries out of canonical order (e.g. `report` before `execute`) | Validation error at load time |
| `parallel_platforms: true` | Validation error (UAT W3 line 222) |
| `package` in `phases:` without `package.submit_terminal_state` | Validation error, **only when `package` is in `phases:`** |
| `package.submit_terminal_state` not in 4-word vocab | Validation error, **only when `package` is in `phases:`** |
| `submit_terminal_state: cloud-uploaded` without `service:` | Validation error, **only when `package` is in `phases:`** |
| `scales.rungs` explicitly set together with `scales.override` | Validation error |
| `scales.rungs`/`scales.override` entries are bool | Validation error (bool is an int subclass; would otherwise silently coerce, e.g. `rungs: [true]` -> `1.0`) |
| `execute.phases_arg` not a string (e.g. a list) | Validation error (would otherwise `str()`-coerce to a nonsense value) |
| `output.*_template` not a string (e.g. a mapping) | Validation error (same str()-coercion hazard) |
| `validator_clean_rate_floor` outside `[0.0, 1.0]` | Validation error |
| `preflight.free_space_min_gib` < 0 | Validation error (must be non-negative — `_require_nonnegative_float`) |
| `preflight.free_space_min_gib` == 0 | **Not** an error — an explicit disk-gate opt-out that turns the free-space floor OFF, emitted as a loud `[disk-gate] DISABLED` warning (`disk_gate_disabled_warning`), not a validation failure |
| `preflight` not in `phases:` but `preflight.free_space_min_gib` set | Validation warning (telemetry-only run) |
| `platforms.include` / `benchmarks.include` entry absent from the registry | **Not** a `ConfigError` — `resolve_platforms`/`resolve_benchmarks` silently drop the id, and `enumerate_cells_with_pruning` records a visible `pruned-registry` accounting row per dropped platform/benchmark (see Section 10's compatibility-pruning note and `tests.uat.matrix.missing_platforms_from_include`/`missing_benchmarks_from_include`) |

Three of the `package:` rules above are conditioned on phase membership
(not on the section merely being present) so that a stale `package:`
block on a config that never runs the `package` phase does not block
loading — mirroring the existing `preflight` leniency in the last row.

**Not currently enforced.** `report.cross_scale_coverage_min_pairs` set
while `report` is absent from `phases:` is inert (the floor is simply
never evaluated, since the report phase that would check it never runs)
rather than a `ConfigError`. This differs from earlier drafts of this
spec, which claimed it as a validation error; no code path ever
implemented that check.

**Default-off teeth.** Per the methodology spec's Finding 1 scoping,
`cross_scale_coverage_min_pairs` defaults `null` (no enforcement).
Sweep authors opt in explicitly.

## 4. Make targets

Args below are the real Makefile signatures (`Makefile` targets `uat-*`);
`[...]` marks an optional make-var.

| Target | Args | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `make uat-cell` | `PLATFORM= BENCHMARK= SCALE=` `[PHASES=] [COMPRESSION=] [TIMEOUT_S=] [LOG_DIR=]` | Single-cell execution. Smallest debugging unit. (W3) |
| `make uat-execute` | `CONFIG=` `[DATABASES_ROOT=] [NO_CLEANUP=1]` | Full execute phase: enumerate + ladder + cleanup. Stops after report. (W4) |
| `make uat-validate` | `RESULTS_DIR= OUTPUT_TSV=` `[FLOOR=0.80]` | Standalone validate phase against an existing results dir. (W5) |
| `make uat-package` | `CONFIG= SUBMISSIONS_DIR= RESULTS="r1.json r2.json ..."` | Standalone package phase. Reads `submit_terminal_state` from YAML. (W6) |
| `make uat-explorer-smoke` | `BUNDLES_DIR= OUTPUT_DIR= LOG_DIR=` `[BROWSERS=chromium]` | Standalone explorer build + Playwright. (W7) |
| `make uat-report` | `CELLS_JSONL= OUTPUT_TSV=` `[RUNGS=0.01,0.1,1.0] [CROSS_SCALE_FLOOR=N]` | Standalone TSV roll-up. (W8) |
| `make uat-sweep` | `CONFIG=` `[DRY_RUN=1]` | Full sweep: walks `phases:` list. (W9) |
| `python -m tests.uat._cli preflight` | `--config <path>` | Advisory disk-budget estimate plus current preflight status. |
| `make uat-stress` | `[PLATFORM=] [BENCHMARK=] [SCALE=] [CONFIG=]` | Canned preset for framework-owned stress-test use. (W9) |
| `make uat-artifact-hygiene` | `[OUTPUT=<root>] [THRESHOLD_BYTES=N]` | Local-artifact hygiene guard: applies whenever the resolved output root is outside the worktree (the default `../benchmark_runs` included); no-op when it is inside or when run outside a Git worktree with no external root configured; report-only. Wired into `make pr-preflight`. |
| `make uat-bring-up` | `PLATFORM=` `[TIMEOUT_S=300] [DRY_RUN=1] [BENCHMARK_RUNS_DIR=]` | Bring up one Docker-managed platform in isolation and probe health (measure-then-set `docker_start_timeout_s`). |
| `make uat-prepull` | `PLATFORM=` `[PREPULL_TIMEOUT_S=900] [DRY_RUN=1]` | Pull/build a platform's compose images ahead of a sweep (no health probe); shares `uat-bring-up`'s platform validation. |
| `make uat-docker-cleanup` | `[ENGINE=docker\|container] [MODE=owned\|images\|max] [APPLY=1] [PREFIX=benchbox-uat]` | Interrupted-run recovery: inventories (default) or removes (`APPLY=1`) UAT-owned compose resources. |
| `make uat-gate-check` | `STAGE1= STAGE2= STAGE3=` `[OUTPUT=<path>]` | Aggregates the three release-gate stage `uat_gate_summary.json` files into the combined APPROVE/HOLD evidence file (landed PR #1162). |

**Invocation contract.**

- All targets accept `BENCHBOX_OUTPUT_DIR` for runs root, defaulting
  to `~/Developer/benchmark_runs/`.
- All targets exit non-zero on phase failure; the report phase exit
  code is the highest non-zero seen across phases.
- Logs land under `output.logs_dir_template` resolved from the YAML
  (or, for single-cell debugging, under `~/Developer/benchmark_runs/
  logs/uat_<date>/`).
- `make uat-stress` accepts `PLATFORM=`, `BENCHMARK=`, and `SCALE=`
  make variables for focused stress runs. Internally it loads
  `tests/uat/configs/stress-default.yaml` and applies a closed set of
  overrides defined below.

**Env-var override contract for `make uat-stress`.** Only three
overrides are recognised; any other `MAKE_VAR=` is ignored (no
silent passthrough):

| Env var | YAML field overridden | Type | Effect when unset |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PLATFORM` | `platforms.include` (set to `[$PLATFORM]`) and `platforms.groups` cleared | str | `platforms.groups` from YAML used as-is |
| `BENCHMARK` | `benchmarks.include` (set to `[$BENCHMARK]`) and `benchmarks.groups` cleared | str | `benchmarks.groups` from YAML used as-is |
| `SCALE` | `scales.override` (set to `float($SCALE)`); `scales.rungs` cleared | float | YAML's `scales.rungs` or `scales.override` used as-is |

If `PLATFORM` and `BENCHMARK` are both set, the YAML's `groups`
fields are both cleared and `include` lists are both replaced.
If `SCALE` and YAML's `scales.rungs` are both present, `SCALE`
wins.

Other targets (`make uat-cell`, `make uat-execute`, `make
uat-sweep`, etc.) do not honour these env vars; they read the
YAML config verbatim. The override mechanism is specific to the
canned stress preset.

**No `benchbox` CLI surface change (weaker than originally chartered).**
UAT follow-up work must not change user-visible `benchbox` commands or
options. This was originally enforced by
`tests/uat/test_no_cli_surface_drift.py` failing on any click
command/option/argument/group decorator change plus a `submit()`/`run()`
signature diff, with only the internal `submit.py` validator refactor
allowlisted. That guard has since been loosened by intervening,
individually-chartered CLI changes: `ALLOWED_INTERNAL_CLI_FILES` now
allowlists 29 `benchbox/cli/` files (module-level, not decorator-level --
any change to those files' CLI surface is unchecked), and
`ALLOWED_HIDDEN_COMPAT_CLI_FILES` (a subset of the above, currently 8
files including `submit.py` and `run.py`) skips the click-surface AST
diff entirely for files whose signature was intentionally changed by a
landed PR (`--funding`/`--notes` on `submit`, `--analyze-plans` on `run`).
The guard's real, current guarantee: click surface drift is caught only
for `benchbox/cli/` files **not** in `ALLOWED_INTERNAL_CLI_FILES`, and the
`submit`/`run`/`convert`/`visualize` signature-diff check
(`FORBIDDEN_CLI_SURFACE_FUNCTIONS`) only fires for files not in
`ALLOWED_HIDDEN_COMPAT_CLI_FILES`. It is a drift *tripwire* for
un-reviewed changes, not a hard freeze on the whole CLI surface.

## 5. Stress Workflow Retirement

`make uat-stress` is the sole local stress-test entrypoint. It loads
`tests/uat/configs/stress-default.yaml`, applies the closed
`PLATFORM=`, `BENCHMARK=`, and `SCALE=` override set described above,
and runs through the same typed config/orchestrator path as every other
UAT sweep. The retired shell workflow has no compatibility shim.

## 6. Replay artifact spec — `tests/uat/configs/uat-2026-05-02.yaml`

Encode the 2026-05-02 sweep as a historical replay config:

```yaml
name: "uat-2026-05-02"
description: "Historical replay of the 2026-05-02 results-explorer multi-scale corpus sweep"

phases: [preflight, execute, validate, package, explorer_smoke, report]

platforms:
  groups: ["sql", "dataframe"]
  exclude: []
benchmarks:
  groups: ["all"]
scales:
  rungs: [0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
execute:
  per_cell_timeout_s: 600
  early_stop_after_s: 180
  early_stop_on_failure: true
  phases_arg: "load,power"
  skip_unreachable: true
cleanup:
  preserve_datagen: true
  prune_databases: true
  docker_manage_platforms: false
  docker_platform_switch: "off"
preflight:
  free_space_min_gib: 5
  free_space_path: "~/Developer/benchmark_runs"
validate:
  validator_clean_rate_floor: 0.80
package:
  submit_terminal_state: "local-stage"
explorer_smoke:
  playwright_browsers: ["chromium"]
report:
  matrix_summary_tsv: "matrix_summary.tsv"
  cross_scale_coverage_min_pairs: null
output:
  logs_dir_template: "~/Developer/benchmark_runs/logs/uat_20260502_replay"
```

**Structural parity assertion (W10) — header-only, not a row-count
replay.** The slow-marked test `tests/uat/test_replay_2026_05_02.py`
runs the orchestrator in dry-run mode against this config and asserts
only that `tests.uat.phases.report.REPORT_HEADER` (the live code's
column list) matches the checked-in fixture
`tests/uat/fixtures/uat-2026-05-02-matrix-summary-header.tsv` byte-for-byte
(both currently 13 tab-separated columns, below). The test's own
docstring is explicit: "This is not a row-count replay." No candidate/
attempted/pruned cell count from the 2026-05-02 retrospective (1,530
candidate, 527 attempted, 133 ladder-pruned, 870 reachability-skipped) is
asserted anywhere in this test — `run_sweep`'s dry-run mode records 0 for
every phase and never writes the TSV body, so there is nothing to compare
row counts against. A second fast test,
`test_replay_config_has_expected_shape`, separately smoke-checks a
handful of the YAML's own keys (`name`, `scales.rungs`,
`execute.per_cell_timeout_s`, `execute.early_stop_after_s`,
`package.submit_terminal_state`, `report.cross_scale_coverage_min_pairs`).

```
platform | benchmark | scale | status | terminal_state | elapsed_s | log_path | result_path | submit_terminal_state | validator_status | source_commit_sha | source_dirty | throughput_check
```

The header has grown twice since the original 9-column TSV this section
once documented: `submit_terminal_state` was inserted in PR #247 between
`result_path` and `validator_status`, and `terminal_state`,
`source_commit_sha`, `source_dirty`, `throughput_check` were added later
(source-provenance and throughput-check plumbing) without a corresponding
spec update until now. External consumers parsing the TSV by positional
index must re-derive the column offset from `REPORT_HEADER`
(`tests/uat/phases/report.py`) rather than trust this document's prior
9- or 10-column count.

Wall-clock match is impossible (dry-run prints intent without
invoking benchbox); structural (header) parity is the bar.

**Historical status.** This config is historical evidence. The file's
first line includes `# HISTORICAL — record of the 2026-05-02 sweep. Do
not edit; if behaviour drifts from this config, fix the framework OR
clone to a dated successor.` Section 9 expands on the content policy.

## 7. Open questions for the user

Reply yes/no per question (or "accept defaults" to take all five
defaults). Anything unaddressed defaults to the "Default" line below.

1. **`tests/uat/` vs `tests/uat_runner/` for the package directory
   name?**
   - Default: `tests/uat/`. Brevity matches `tests/integration/`,
     `tests/e2e/`, `tests/performance/`.
   - Consequence of `tests/uat_runner/`: clearer intent but four
     extra characters in every import path.

2. **Does the W1 spec require an independent reviewer beyond the
   user?**
   - Default: no. User reviews; the adversarial framing in Section 8
     mitigates self-bias finding 084354.
   - Consequence of yes: file a sub-TODO for an independent reviewer
     pass before W2 unlocks.

3. **Should `make uat-stress` replace the retired shell workflow?**
   - Decision: yes. The framework owns stress-test matrix iteration;
     no thin delegator or compatibility shim remains.

4. **`tests/uat/configs/uat-2026-05-02.yaml` — historical replay
   (immutable historical record) or starting template (editable)?**
   - Default: historical replay. New sweep configs cloned from it via
     `cp tests/uat/configs/uat-2026-05-02.yaml tests/uat/configs/
     uat-NEW.yaml`. Section 9 codifies this.
   - Consequence of "starting template": reduces config sprawl but
     loses the historical-fidelity guarantee that motivates W10's
     parity test.

5. **`submit_terminal_state` default for the stress preset — should
   `make uat-stress` have NO package phase, or emit `local-stage` by
   default?**
   - Default: stress preset omits `package` from `phases:` entirely.
     Terminal-state is irrelevant for stress runs (verification
     focus is "does it run", not "does the bundle validate").
   - Consequence of "local-stage default": stress runs auto-package;
     extra disk+wall-clock for no return because the bundles are
     never submitted.

## 8. Adversarial framing — strongest argument against each design choice

Per blind-spot finding 084354 (self-bias risk in stress-tests),
self-designed adversarial framing tends to under-weight failure
modes the proposer didn't already consider. The user is the
independent reviewer; this section starts the conversation, not
ends it.

### 8.1 Against building a Python framework at all

> "Convention plus a small wrapper is sufficient. The next sweep author
> can read prior run artifacts for patterns and write a new bespoke
> driver. Framework adds engineering cost and a YAML schema to learn for
> marginal benefit."

**Counter.** The 2026-05-02 sweep author did read prior artifacts and
still re-invented timeout handling, matrix reporting, validation
rollups, and packaging. The "read for patterns" path empirically
produces drift, not reuse. The framework is the reusable boundary for
that machinery, not a new abstraction for its own sake.

### 8.2 Against `tests/uat/` location

> "UAT is operator tooling, not a test category. `tests/` should hold
> pytest tests. Put the framework in `_project/scripts/uat/` or
> `tools/uat/` and don't pollute the test directory."

**Counter.** Per user direction (2026-05-03), `_project/` is a mixed
dev-private tree (handoffs, blind-spots, audits, baselines); critical
machinery must live in tracked, version-controlled directories. The
existing `tests/` siblings (`integration/`, `e2e/`, `performance/`,
`system/`, `validation/`, `parity/`, `contracts/`) cover test-flavoured
infrastructure that doesn't fit the unit-test mould either. UAT is
structurally a long, side-effect-heavy, multi-platform test category;
`tests/uat/` follows the precedent. The fast tests added in W2/W3/W4
ARE pytest, covering unit-level logic (port maps, ladder pruning,
schema validation).

### 8.3 Against YAML configs

> "YAML is over-engineered for what amounts to a function call. Just
> let sweep authors write a Python script that calls `tests.uat.runner.
> sweep(...)` directly. Configs become docstrings."

**Counter.** The 2026-05-02 sweep parameters need to be replayable
deterministically. A Python script is mutable code; a YAML config
under version control is the historical record. Section 9's historical
content policy depends on YAML being declarative data, not code. The
schema doubles as documentation: a sweep author reads the schema in
Section 3 and knows what the framework can express.

### 8.4 Against `make` targets (vs a `benchbox uat` subcommand)

> "Adding a `benchbox uat` subcommand keeps everything in one CLI.
> Users already know `benchbox`; learning `make uat-*` is friction."

**Counter.** `benchbox` ships on PyPI to project users. UAT is a
project-developer concern; sweep machinery on PyPI bloats the user
CLI surface and pulls dev-only deps into the install. The repo
already uses `make` for every other developer concern (`worktree-*`,
`blind-spots-*`, `pr-*`, `dev-loop-metrics`); UAT joins the same
pattern. The friction of one `make` target name is real but
bounded; the friction of bloated user-CLI surface is permanent.

### 8.5 Against an explicit `submit_terminal_state` field

> "The four-word vocab is over-formalised. Sweep authors know what
> they meant. Inferring from the presence of a `--service` flag or
> a PR-target branch is enough."

**Counter.** Inference is exactly what bit the 2026-05-02 sweep
(Finding 3 in the methodology spec). The agent inferred `local-stage`
from validation evidence; the TODO could not have *forced* a
different choice. Required, declarative, no inference. The validation
rule in Section 3 ("required when package phase enabled") makes the
declaration unavoidable.

### 8.6 Against the structural-parity replay test

> "It's a slow test that asserts a TSV row count matches a historical
> file. The historical file is one snapshot; future code changes that
> legitimately alter ladder pruning will keep failing this test
> forever."

**Counter.** The test is `@pytest.mark.slow` and excluded from the
fast-test default. It runs on demand or when the framework's matrix
logic changes. When ladder pruning legitimately changes, the
historical file is updated as part of the same PR (the file is in
`~/Developer/benchmark_runs/logs/`, off-tree; the test compares a
snapshot copy committed under `tests/uat/fixtures/`). The
fixture-update flow makes intentional changes explicit.

### 8.7 Against opt-in `cross_scale_coverage_min_pairs`

> "Optional teeth nobody enables are decorative. Either default it on
> (forces UAT authors to think about cross-scale coverage) or remove
> it entirely (the methodology spec already covers this via convention)."

**Counter.** The methodology spec (Finding 1) explicitly scoped
tooling enforcement OUT — false-positive risk from refusing `done`
on a satisfied-but-via-absence-note unit. Default-off keeps the
framework consistent with that scoping. Removing the field entirely
forecloses the option of adding teeth later if the convention drifts;
keeping it opt-in lets a future sweep author enable it without a
schema change.

### 8.8 Against the W1 user-approval gate

> "An 11-work-unit TODO with a hard spec gate is over-process. Just
> ship W2-W11 and review at PR time. The user reviews PRs anyway."

**Counter.** Each W has its own PR per the TODO's "vertical slices"
discipline. Without a spec gate, the user reviews 11 PRs against an
implicit shared design. The spec gate is one review of one document
that pre-empts wrong directions across all 11. The 2026-05-02 sweep
ran with implicit shared design; the retrospective is the cost.

## 9. `tests/uat/configs/` content policy

The `tests/uat/configs/` tree holds three lifecycle classes, distinguished by
file-header comment and, for generated rerun shards, by location:

### 9.1 Editable templates

```yaml
# TEMPLATE — copy and edit for sweep-specific runs.
name: "stress-default"
...
```

- Mutable; PRs may edit them.
- New sweep authors clone a template, for example `cp
  tests/uat/configs/stress-default.yaml tests/uat/configs/uat-<new>.yaml`,
  and edit the copy.
- The canned `stress-default.yaml` is the canonical example; future
  templates (e.g. a `tpch-only-fast-platforms.yaml`) follow the same
  header convention.
- `# TEMPLATE` also covers canonical, repeatedly-run operational configs
  that are edited in place across releases rather than cloned per sweep
  (e.g. `release-gate-0{1,2,3}-*.yaml`, `uat-enabled-platforms-*.yaml`,
  `uat-throughput-duckdb-nightly.yaml`) -- the distinguishing trait is
  "mutable, not a one-shot historical snapshot", not "always cloned".

### 9.2 Historical replay configs

```yaml
# HISTORICAL — record of the 2026-05-02 sweep. Do not edit; if behaviour
# drifts from this config, fix the framework OR clone to a dated successor.
name: "uat-2026-05-02"
...
```

- Historical evidence; avoid editing in place.
- There is no hash ceremony. Reviews should reject gratuitous edits,
  but the framework does not maintain a separate frozen-file guard.

### 9.3 Generated rerun shards

Generated rerun shards are operational evidence emitted by a sweep's manual
follow-up -- an operator re-running a triaged subset of failed cells in a
smaller, cell-scoped config (often one file per platform). They live under
`tests/uat/configs/generated-rerun-shards/`, carry a generated/frozen header,
and must not be cloned as reusable starting points. This is unrelated to the
retired `--resume <manifest>` mechanism (see the "Resume (retired)" note in
Section 3): these shards are ordinary sweep configs, not runtime state.

### 9.4 PR conventions

| Action | Header | Reviewer expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Add a new editable template | `# TEMPLATE` | Verify the template's `phases:` list and defaults match a real reuse case. |
| Edit a `# TEMPLATE` file | `# TEMPLATE` | Standard review; no special protocol. |
| Add a new historical replay (post-sweep snapshot) | `# HISTORICAL` | Verify the `name:` field encodes the sweep's date/identity. |
| Edit a `# HISTORICAL` file | (manual review) | Prefer a dated successor unless the framework contract itself drifted. |
| Add a generated rerun shard | Generated header under `generated-rerun-shards/` | Verify it is frozen evidence from a named sweep, not a template. |

The conceptual policy is "templates are starting points; historical configs and
generated rerun shards are evidence."

**Enforcement.** `tests/uat/test_config.py::test_top_level_config_carries_recognized_lifecycle_header`
(uat-config-schema-spec-realignment w4) fails the fast lane if any top-level
config under `tests/uat/configs/` is missing a recognized `# TEMPLATE` /
`# HISTORICAL` first line -- this policy is no longer convention-only.
A companion corpus guard (`test_every_corpus_config_loads_and_enumerates_nonempty`,
w3) loads and enumerates every checked-in config, including
`generated-rerun-shards/`, asserting a non-empty cell set and zero unknown
`platforms.include`/`benchmarks.include` entries.

## 10. What UAT does NOT assert

The UAT framework is a release-gate orchestration layer: it proves that
configured platform/benchmark cells can be enumerated, executed,
validated, packaged, reported, and cleaned up under the current operator
workflow. It does not replace deeper benchmark-correctness suites.

> **Vocabulary (charter decision, 2026-05-31).** "Release-gate orchestration"
> is the chartered term for this layer. The earlier develop-only "certification"
> wording was never chartered here. Decision: Path A — use release-gate
> vocabulary for the operations surface; do **not** charter a standing
> cert-operations surface beyond the named evidence artifacts. The mechanical
> rename landed in the UAT runbook, staged configs, ordering helper, and tests:
> `docs/operations/uat-framework.md` "Release-gate re-run",
> `tests/uat/configs/release-gate-0{1,2,3}-*.yaml`, and
> `tests/uat/phases/report.py:release_gate_ordering_violations`.

In particular, UAT does not assert query cardinality, per-query
measurement coverage, or stored answer row-count invariants for every
local SQL platform. Those checks remain in
`tests/integration/test_local_platform_benchmark_matrix.py`, which runs
real local platform x benchmark cases under the integration/stress
markers and validates the result payload against expected query and
row-count behavior. Keep that test when changing UAT: it covers a
different contract than the UAT execute/report phases.

The shared local-SQL platform set lives in `tests/uat/matrix.py` as
`LOCAL_SQL_PLATFORMS` so UAT platform grouping and the integration
matrix cannot drift silently. Changes to that tuple must account for
both release-gate ergonomics and the heavier invariant test's runtime
cost.

## 11. Migration of existing artifacts

| Artifact | Action | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| retired shell stress workflow | Removed; `make uat-stress` is the sole local stress entrypoint | W11 |
| `scripts/uat_validator_rollup.py` | Removed; `tests/uat/phases/validate.py` owns the roll-up in-process | follow-up W5 |
| `scripts/validate_submission.py` | Thin CLI wrapper around `benchbox.validation.bundle`; still used by published-results CI | follow-up W4 |
| `benchbox/validation/bundle.py` | Shared public bundle validator mirrored to `published-results` with the script wrapper | follow-up W4 |
| `~/Developer/benchmark_runs/logs/uat_20260502/` | Snapshot a copy of `matrix_summary.tsv` to `tests/uat/fixtures/uat-2026-05-02-matrix-summary.tsv` for the W10 parity test | W10 |
| `_project/handoffs/results-explorer-uat-retrospective-20260502.md` | No retrofit; historical document | (no change) |
| `tests/uat/configs/uat-2026-05-02.yaml` | New file at W10; HISTORICAL | W10 |
| `tests/uat/configs/stress-default.yaml` | New file at W9; TEMPLATE | W9 |
| `Makefile` | Add `uat-cell` (W3), `uat-execute` (W4), `uat-validate` (W5), `uat-package` (W6), `uat-explorer-smoke` (W7), `uat-report` (W8), `uat-sweep`/`uat-stress` (W9) | W3-W9 |
| `CLAUDE.md` Pre-approved Commands | Add `make uat-*` entries | W11 |
| `docs/operations/uat-framework.md` | New operator guide | W11 |
| `tests/uat/README.md` | New developer guide | W11 |

## 12. Implementation sequencing and PR cadence

One PR per work unit, vertical slices. No monolithic delivery.

| Work unit | Delivers | Test added | Make target |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1 | This spec | (none) | (none) |
| W2 | `tests/uat/matrix.py`, `tests/uat/test_matrix.py` (matches the parent TODO's W2 scope verbatim — matrix machinery only) | Fast | (none) |
| W3 | `tests/uat/runner.py`, `tests/uat/timeouts.py`, `tests/uat/config.py` (minimal — only the fields W3 needs: top-level `name`, `execute.per_cell_timeout_s`, `execute.phases_arg`), `tests/uat/test_runner.py`, `tests/uat/test_timeouts.py`, `tests/uat/test_config.py` | Fast | `make uat-cell` |
| W4 | `tests/uat/ladder.py`, `tests/uat/cleanup.py`, `tests/uat/phases/{preflight,enumerate,execute}.py`, full `config.py` schema coverage (remaining sections), fast tests | Fast | `make uat-execute` |
| W5 | `tests/uat/phases/validate.py`, fast test | Fast | `make uat-validate` |
| W6 | `tests/uat/phases/package.py`, fast test | Fast | `make uat-package` |
| W7 | `tests/uat/phases/explorer_smoke.py`, fast test | Fast | `make uat-explorer-smoke` |
| W8 | `tests/uat/phases/report.py`, fast test | Fast | `make uat-report` |
| W9 | `tests/uat/orchestrator.py`, `tests/uat/configs/stress-default.yaml`, fast test for orchestrator | Fast | `make uat-sweep`, `make uat-stress` |
| W10 | `tests/uat/configs/uat-2026-05-02.yaml`, `tests/uat/fixtures/uat-2026-05-02-matrix-summary.tsv`, `tests/uat/test_replay_2026_05_02.py` | Slow | (none) |
| W11 | `docs/operations/uat-framework.md`, `tests/uat/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` updates, optional bash-script delegation | (no new tests) | (none) |

**Verification at each W.** Per the parent TODO's `verification:` block,
each PR adds tests and the sweep verification commands stay green. The
final-state verification commands (after W11) are:

```bash
test -f _project/specs/uat-framework.md
make uat-cell PLATFORM=duckdb BENCHMARK=tpch SCALE=0.01
make uat-stress PLATFORM=duckdb BENCHMARK=tpch
make uat-sweep CONFIG=tests/uat/configs/uat-2026-05-02.yaml DRY_RUN=1
uv run -- python -m pytest -m fast -q
test ! -f scripts/local_stress_test.sh
test ! -f scripts/uat_validator_rollup.py
uv run -- python -m tests.uat._cli --help
uv run -- python -m pytest tests/uat/test_no_cli_surface_drift.py -q
```

## 13. Open risks, watched but not blocking

- **Risk: timeout wrapper semantics drift.**
  Mitigation: the fast test exercises the timeout wrapper with a
  3-second sleep and a 1-second cap; exit-code semantics remain
  (124 on timeout).
- **Risk: registry-driven enumeration races a registry rename.**
  Mitigation: the framework imports `benchbox.core.benchmark_registry`
  directly (no eval, no shell-out); a registry rename surfaces as a
  Python ImportError at enumerate time, not a silent skip.
- **Risk: parallel-platform restriction is enforced at config load
  but bypassable via direct `phases/execute.py` invocation.**
  Mitigation: `phases/execute.py` itself reads
  `config.execute.parallel_platforms` and asserts False; the YAML
  validation is the first line of defence, the runtime assertion is
  the second.
- **Risk: the 2026-05-02 retrospective TSV row count drifts from the
  W10 fixture.** Mitigation: the fixture is a snapshot copy committed
  under `tests/uat/fixtures/`; the historical log file under
  `~/Developer/benchmark_runs/` may be tidied off the host without
  breaking the parity test.
