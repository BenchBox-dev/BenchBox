"""`make ci-lint` must not confuse "runs on CI" with "means something on CI".

`develop-post-merge.yml` runs `make ci-lint` directly on a real, ephemeral
GitHub-hosted runner (not as a local-parity convenience -- as a blocking gate
wired into `auto-revert-on-failure`). Two of its ~23 guards read state that
only exists on a developer machine and used to handle that badly:
`agent-identity-check` resolves a Git identity the runner does not have (a
noisy, environment-caused failure before #1558), and `skill-sync-check`
shells out to a hardcoded local absolute path that plainly does not exist on
a runner (a *silent* no-op that exits 0 and reads as coverage in the Actions
log while checking nothing -- the more dangerous failure mode, because nobody
investigates a green check).

`_project/scripts/ci_lint_environment_gate.py` is the fix: one declarative
table of guards that cannot produce a meaningful result on
`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`, consulted by the `ci-lint` recipe before each listed
guard, replacing the ad hoc per-guard `if $GITHUB_ACTIONS` special case.

Every test below is chosen to fail for a specific wrong "fix", not just to
exercise the happy path:

* `..._never_gates_the_commit_range_control` and
  `..._leaves_real_guards_unconditional` fail if the exception table (or the
  Makefile wiring) is widened past the two documented guards -- the
  "disable everything on CI" cheat that would satisfy a shallower test
  asserting only "ci-lint exits 0 on a runner".
* `..._gates_agent_identity_check_on_a_runner` and
  `..._gates_skill_sync_check_on_a_runner` parse the actual `ci-lint` recipe
  text and fail if the gate script exists and classifies correctly but was
  never wired into the Makefile -- the specific way a "fix" could add a
  correct-looking module that changes nothing about what `make ci-lint`
  actually runs.
