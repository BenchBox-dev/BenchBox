"""Release PRs are gated by their release checks alone, and cleanup cannot fail a release.

A release PR carries the curated release tree, which lacks the development
files that the CI and oracle-review lanes read, so those workflows skip the
release base. The release workflow's artifact cleanup queries artifacts by name
because listing every repository artifact fails intermittently.
