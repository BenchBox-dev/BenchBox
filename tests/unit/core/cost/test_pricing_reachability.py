"""Reachability and fail-closed coverage for the pricing subsystem.

Reachability: every workload_type, edition, node type, SKU, and region bucket
that production can emit must resolve to its own table entry rather than a
silent fallback. The Databricks workload test drives the real extraction helper
so a newly emitted workload_type absent from the price table fails here (C1).

Fail-closed: an unknown platform yields no value, and an end-to-end run with
no usable cost resolves to cost_status unavailable with no number attached.
(Per-key fallback removal lands with the fail-closed mechanism; these tests pin
the layers that already close.)
