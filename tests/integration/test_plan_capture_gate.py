"""Blocking plan-capture CI gate.

This is the small, credential-free gate wired into PR CI. It drives the production
``run_plan_capture_phase`` path against in-process engines and pins the release
contracts that have regressed after merge: parsed plans land, structural
fingerprints are stable, and write statements are not double-executed by capture.
