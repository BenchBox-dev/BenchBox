"""Forced-regeneration probe for the Data Vault cross-surface gate.

Ported from the deleted staged-gate test when Data Vault graduated to enforced
GATES: every build must regenerate (probes can never pass on a stale
manifest), the probe manifest must be recorded, and poisoning all 21 table
files followed by a rebuild must restore full data. The builder sets
``force_regenerate=True``; without this probe a future change that stops
honoring it would go unnoticed.

Slow lane: two full cell builds plus a poisoned rebuild.
