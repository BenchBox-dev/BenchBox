# Unified Test Runner

The unified test runner consolidates functionality from the individual test runners (`run_tpch_tests.py`, `run_tpcds_tests.py`, `run_coverage.py`) into a single comprehensive tool.

## Features

- **Benchmark Support**: All BenchBox benchmarks (TPCH, TPCDS, TPCDI, SSB, AmpLab, ClickBench, H2ODB, Merge, Primitives, TPCHavoc)
- **Test Modes**: Unit, Integration, Performance, Specialized tests
- **Database Support**: DuckDB and SQLite testing
- **Coverage Integration**: Built-in coverage reporting
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-worker test execution
- **Execution Strategies**: Development, CI, and Integration optimized modes
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed test reports with metrics

## Usage

### Using Makefile Commands (Recommended)

These Makefile targets cover common scenarios. `make test` runs the default test suite (fast tests). The others run
all tests, unit tests only, integration tests only, TPC-H tests only, and tests with coverage.

```bash
make test
make test-all
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-tpch
make coverage
```

### Basic Usage with Unified Test Runner

The commands run all unit tests, run TPC-H tests with coverage, and run integration tests in parallel.

```bash
uv run -- python tests/utilities/unified_test_runner.py --mode unit

uv run -- python tests/utilities/unified_test_runner.py --benchmark tpch --coverage

uv run -- python tests/utilities/unified_test_runner.py --mode integration --parallel --workers 4
```

### Direct pytest Usage

Run tests directly with pytest and markers. The commands run unit tests only, fast TPC-H tests, DuckDB integration
tests, and tests with coverage.

```bash
uv run -- python -m pytest -m unit
uv run -- python -m pytest -m "tpch and fast"
uv run -- python -m pytest -m "integration and duckdb"
uv run -- python -m pytest --cov=benchbox
```

### Advanced Marker Combinations

The first command runs specific benchmarks with speed filtering. The next two are database-specific testing. The last
is feature-specific testing.

```bash
uv run -- python -m pytest -m "tpch and fast and not slow"

uv run -- python -m pytest -m "duckdb and unit"
uv run -- python -m pytest -m "sqlite and integration"

uv run -- python -m pytest -m "olap or advanced_sql"
```

## Execution Strategies

### Development Strategy (`--strategy development`)
- Optimized for fast feedback during development
- Runs unit tests first
- Stops on first failure if `--fail-fast` is used
- Focuses on quick validation

### CI Strategy (`--strategy ci`)
- Optimized for continuous integration
- Runs fast tests first, then slow tests
- Comprehensive coverage
- Parallel execution optimized

### Integration Strategy (`--strategy integration`)
- Focuses on DuckDB integration testing
- Emphasis on database connectivity and query execution
- Useful for validating database-specific functionality

## Command Line Options

### Test Selection
- `--benchmark`: Choose benchmarks (tpch, tpcds, primitives, etc.)
- `--mode`: Choose test modes (unit, integration, performance, specialized)
- `--duckdb/--sqlite`: Database selection
- `--markers`: Include tests with specific markers
- `--exclude-markers`: Exclude tests with specific markers

### Execution Control
- `--parallel`: Enable parallel execution
- `--workers`: Number of parallel workers
- `--fail-fast`: Stop on first failure
- `--timeout`: Set test timeout
- `--verbose`: Verbose output

### Coverage Options
- `--coverage`: Enable coverage reporting
- `--min-coverage`: Minimum coverage threshold
- `--output`: Output format (term, json, junit)
- `--output-location`: Custom output location

### Reporting
- `--report`: Generate detailed report
- `--report-file`: Custom report filename
- `--collect-only`: Collect tests without running
- `--dry-run`: Show commands without execution

## Examples

### Quick Development Testing
Each `make` target is equivalent to the `pytest` command after it. The commands run fast unit tests for active
development, and tests for one benchmark. The last command runs unit tests with verbose output.
```bash
make test-fast
uv run -- python -m pytest -m fast

make test-tpch
uv run -- python -m pytest -m tpch

uv run -- python -m pytest -m unit -v
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
`make test-ci` is comprehensive CI testing, and `make coverage-report` runs tests with coverage for CI. Each is
equivalent to the `pytest` command after it. `make coverage-opt-in-all` includes stress and live tests, so use it only
when their services and credentials are available. `make test-parallel` is explicit full-tree parallel testing and
requires live services and credentials.
```bash
make test-ci
uv run -- python -m pytest -c pytest-ci.ini -m "not (slow or stress or resource_heavy or live_integration)"

make coverage-report
uv run -- python -m pytest -c pytest-ci.ini -m "not (stress or resource_heavy or live_integration)" --cov=benchbox --cov-report=xml --junit-xml=test-results.xml

make coverage-opt-in-all

make test-parallel
uv run -- python -m pytest -n auto --tb=short
```

### Integration Validation
The commands run DuckDB integration testing, the full integration test suite, and integration tests with coverage.
Each `make` target is equivalent to the `pytest` command after it.
```bash
make test-duckdb
uv run -- python -m pytest -m duckdb

make test-integration
uv run -- python -m pytest -m "integration and not live_integration"

uv run -- python -m pytest -m integration --cov=benchbox
```

### Performance Testing
The first command runs performance tests only. The second runs the fast performance tests.
```bash
uv run -- python -m pytest -m performance

uv run -- python -m pytest -m "performance and fast"
```

## Migration from Individual Runners

### From `run_tpch_tests.py`
The first command is the old way. The `make` target and `pytest` command are the new way.
```bash
python tests/run_tpch_tests.py

make test-tpch
uv run -- python -m pytest -m tpch
```

### From `run_tpcds_tests.py`
The first command is the old way. The `make` target and `pytest` command are the new way.
```bash
python tests/run_tpcds_tests.py minimal

make test-tpcds
uv run -- python -m pytest -m "tpcds and fast"
```

### From `run_coverage.py`
The first command is the old way. The `make` target and `pytest` command are the new way.
```bash
python tests/run_coverage.py --report html

make coverage-html
uv run -- python -m pytest --cov=benchbox --cov-report=html
```

## Error Handling

The unified test runner provides comprehensive error handling:

- **Timeout Protection**: Tests that exceed timeout limits are terminated gracefully
- **Parallel Execution Safety**: Worker failures don't crash the entire test suite
- **Coverage Integration**: Coverage failures are reported but don't stop test execution
- **Database Connectivity**: Database connection issues are handled gracefully
- **Detailed Logging**: All errors are logged with context and suggestions

## Output Formats

- **Terminal** (default): Human-readable output with colors and progress
- **JSON**: Machine-readable format for CI/CD integration
- **JUnit XML**: Compatible with most CI systems and IDEs
- **Detailed Reports**: Markdown reports with comprehensive metrics

## Integration with pytest

The unified test runner leverages pytest's powerful features:

- **Markers**: Use pytest markers for test categorization
- **Fixtures**: Full compatibility with existing pytest fixtures
- **Plugins**: Support for pytest plugins like pytest-xdist, pytest-cov
- **Configuration**: Respects pytest.ini and pyproject.toml configurations

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate strategies** for different contexts (development vs CI)
2. **Leverage parallel execution** for faster feedback
3. **Set coverage thresholds** to maintain code quality
4. **Use markers** to organize and filter tests effectively
5. **Generate reports** for tracking test trends and coverage
6. **Configure timeouts** to prevent hanging tests
7. **Use database-specific flags** when testing specific integrations
