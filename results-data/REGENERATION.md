# Regeneration Checklist - Tuned Cells Dropped 2026-07-16

**Related TODO:** `tuning-corpus-drop-pre-provenance-tuned-bundles-20260716`
**Decision:** Joe, 2026-07-16 (tuning follow-up batch gate)

## What happened

The 2026-07 tuning remediation (#1176 w0 discovery) proved the tuning config
never reached platform adapters on the direct CLI path, so every bundle in the
checked-in seed corpus claiming `execution.tuning_mode == "tuned"` was almost
certainly physically untuned. Cross-submission comparisons against those
bundles are unsound, so they were removed rather than relabeled.

325 bundles (plus their 325 `.manifest.json` sidecars, 650 files total) were
removed from `results-data/bundles/`. The 203 bundles with no `tuning_mode`
recorded were left untouched - they ingest honestly as "not recorded" and
were never a soundness problem.

After removal: `results-data/corpus-inventory.json` was regenerated
(`uv run -- python scripts/generate_corpus_inventory.py --write`) and every
remaining cohort still meets the >=3-platform depth gate in
`results-data/validate_corpus.py`.

## How to find the removed bundles

The exact file list is in the git history of the removal commit (see the
commit body on the `chore/tuning-corpus-drop` branch / PR). The sweep logic
lives in `_project/scripts/explorer_pipeline/transformer.py::_tuning_mode`,
which reads `config.tuning_mode` first and falls back to
`execution.tuning_mode` for seed-corpus-era bundles.

## Benchmarks with zero remaining coverage

Four benchmarks had no non-tuned bundles in the corpus at all, so removing
their tuned bundles drops them from the checked-in corpus entirely until
regenerated: **ai_primitives**, **joinorder_synthetic** (distinct from the
surviving `joinorder` IMDB benchmark, which keeps 3 not-recorded bundles),
**tpcds** (the standalone TPC-DS benchmark; `tpcds_obt` is unaffected and
still has not-recorded coverage), and **vector_search**. `results-data/corpus-inventory.json` will not list these
benchmark ids again until at least one tuned or not-recorded bundle is
re-added for each.

## Regeneration checklist

Once a platform's tuned path is verified to actually reach adapters
(post-#1176/#1180), the following benchmark x scale cells need fresh
maintainer runs with `--tuning tuned` (or equivalent) to restore tuned
coverage. Platforms are listed as they appeared in the dropped bundles for
that cell; a regenerated cell does not need to reproduce every platform
below, but each dropped platform's tuned result is no longer represented
anywhere in the corpus until it is re-run.

48 benchmark x scale cells, 325 removed platform-tuned bundles total (some
cells have more than one bundle per platform, e.g. DataFusion sql + df
variants both landed under `tuning_mode=tuned`).

## Regeneration steps

1. Confirm the platform's tuned path is fixed and covered by a soundness test
   (see #1176 / #1180 follow-up work).
2. Re-run: `benchbox run --platform <platform> --benchmark <benchmark> --scale <sf> --tuning tuned --phases generate,load,power`
3. Package and add the bundle under `results-data/bundles/`.
4. Regenerate the inventory: `uv run -- python scripts/generate_corpus_inventory.py --write`
5. Re-run `uv run -- python results-data/validate_corpus.py` to confirm the
   cohort still meets the >=3-platform depth gate.

# Post-2026-08-23 trust cut — remaining-gap restore

**Related TODO:** `restore-corpus-coverage-after-20260823-trust-cut`
**Live revalidation:** 2026-09-04 against `results-data/corpus-inventory.json`
(`generated_at` 2026-09-01) and `results-data/validate_corpus.py` (exit 0).

## What happened

The 2026-08-28 trust cut (PRs #1939 develop, #1940 published-results) withdrew
every result run before 2026-08-23. That left a 9-bundle / 3-cohort corpus. The
withdrawal was intentional; coverage has to be rebuilt with fresh runs only.
Do not restore withdrawn bundles from git history.

## Live already-OK cohorts (do not re-run)

As of the 2026-09-04 live inventory the corpus holds **199 bundles**, **10
benchmarks**, and **27 cohorts**, all at the >=3-identity floor. These
benchmarks already have comparable local coverage and must not be re-run for
this restore:

| Benchmark | Live scales with >=3 identities |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| amplab | 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 |
| clickbench | 1.0 (plus DuckDB-only SF 10 version-matrix cells) |
| coffeeshop | 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 |
| h2odb | 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 |
| joinorder | 1.0 |
| read_primitives | 0.01, 0.1 |
| ssb | 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 (plus DuckDB-only SF 10 version-matrix cells) |
| tpcds | 1.0 (plus SF 10 cells) |
| tpch | 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 (plus DuckDB-only SF 10 version-matrix cells) |
| tpch_skew | 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 |

## Alias note: `star_schema`

`star_schema` is a CLI / historical schema-v2 alias of **`ssb`**
(`benchbox/cli/commands/run.py` maps `star_schema` → `ssb`; current SSB
bundles use `benchmark.id = "ssb"`). It is **not** a separate remaining-gap
benchmark. Do not admit a duplicate `star_schema` cohort beside live `ssb`
coverage.

## Remaining zero-coverage local cells (2026-09-04)

Benchmarks with **no** checked-in primary bundles after the trust cut:

| Benchmark | Smallest local target cell | Notes |
|-----------|----------------------------|-------|
| datavault | SF 0.01 × >=3 local platforms | Prefer DuckDB, DataFusion, ClickHouse Local / SQLite |
| flightdata | SF 0.01 × >=3 local platforms | Same local platform set |
| metadata_primitives | SF 1.0 × >=3 local platforms | Scale is unused for sizing; needs three validation-passed platforms |
| nyctaxi | SF 0.01 × >=3 local platforms | |
| tpcdi | SF 0.01 × >=3 local platforms | |
| tpcds_obt | SF 1.0 × >=3 local platforms | Integer SF >= 1 only (TPC-DS generator alignment) |
| tpchavoc | SF 0.01 × >=3 local platforms | Experimental; large query count |
| write_primitives | SF 0.01 × >=3 local platforms | Needs three validation-passed local platforms |
| star_schema | — | Alias of `ssb` — **not admitted as a separate cell** |

Skip SF 10 expansion for this restore. No cloud-vendor account signup
(Databricks / Snowflake / BigQuery). Optional ClickHouse Cloud may remain on
the seed lane as skip-when-secrets-absent only.

## Admission rules for remaining-gap cells

1. Fresh post-2026-08-23 runs only; never copy withdrawn git-history bundles.
2. Real validation phase must execute; admit only when
   `summary.validation == passed`.
3. Do not commit a `benchbox submit` community sidecar unless a community
   submission is genuinely wanted. Sidecar absence continues to derive
   `maintainer-run` trust in `scripts/generate_corpus_inventory.py`.
4. Prefer existing local platforms (DuckDB, DataFusion, SQLite, Polars,
   ClickHouse Local) at the smallest supported scale.
5. Each admitted cohort must meet the >=3-platform floor in
   `results-data/validate_corpus.py`.

## Remaining-gap restore outcome

Recorded when remaining-gap bundles were copied into `results-data/bundles/`
and the inventory regenerated (post-2026-08-23 trust-cut restore):

| Benchmark | Admitted cohorts | Deferred |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| datavault | SF 0.01, SF 0.1 (DuckDB, DataFusion, ClickHouse Local) | SF 1.0 — no full-suite DataFusion validation-passed third platform in local output |
| flightdata | SF 0.01, SF 0.1, SF 1.0 | — |
| nyctaxi | SF 0.01, SF 0.1, SF 1.0 | — |
| tpcdi | SF 0.01, SF 0.1, SF 1.0 | — |
| tpcds_obt | SF 1.0 | — |
| tpchavoc | SF 0.01, SF 0.1, SF 1.0 | — |
| metadata_primitives | — (see deferral) | DuckDB + DataFusion validation-passed locally; ClickHouse Local incompatible (ACL privileges); SQLite fresh run 2026-09-04 failed all 51 queries |
| write_primitives | — (see deferral) | Only DuckDB validation-passed locally; DataFusion SF 0.01 failed missing write-ops tables; ClickHouse Local SF 0.01 failed schema NOT NULL; SQLite/Spark/Polars remain partial |
| star_schema | not applicable | Alias of `ssb`; do not duplicate |
