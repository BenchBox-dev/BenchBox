# Defective Generator Audit: macOS dbgen Address Data

## Verdict

140 of the 395 bundles in the checked-in corpus were generated from TPC-H-family
data written by the defective macOS dbgen builds (pre-#2622), which emitted
non-canonical supplier and customer addresses. Query values that read those
addresses (Q2, Q10, Q15, Q20) are wrong in the affected bundles.

| Tier | Meaning | Bundles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Direct evidence: same-root cache created before the run is non-canonical | 53 |
| B | Presumed: same-root cache regenerated after the run is non-canonical | 52 |
| C | Unresolved: no surviving cache, run predates the 2026-09-24 stale-stamp regeneration | 35 |

Affected benchmarks: tpch (46), tpch_skew (24), read_primitives (18), tpchavoc
(18), datavault (16), transaction_primitives (9), write_primitives (9). All 140
record Darwin/Apple hosts. No benchmark in the list uses dsdgen, so no Windows
TPC-DS scale-factor defect applies to any checked-in bundle.

Per-bundle evidence is in `audit-defective-generators-bundles.csv` (140 rows:
53 A, 52 B, 35 C). Cross-checks performed: `results-data/corpus-inventory.json`
totals 395 bundles; every listed bundle file resolves under
`results-data/bundles/`; recomputed SHA-256 of all 140 primaries matches the
`bundle_hash` recorded in their sidecars (0 mismatches); the packaged
darwin-arm64 dbgen hash is not in the known-defective set.

## Remediation in this change

- Every affected bundle carries `known_defects:
  ["defective-macdbgen-addresses"]` in its `.manifest.json` sidecar (122
  sidecars extended, 18 created for bundles that had none; created sidecars
  record `result_source: internal` so trust labels are unchanged).
- The explorer pipeline reads that entry and sets `ranking_exclusion_reason`
  to `known_defective_data` on both the manifest entry and the detail result,
  which removes the bundle from ranked tables on the next publish. The entry
  is validated against a closed defect vocabulary at submission time; a broken
  or absent sidecar leaves the previous reason untouched.
- Stale-cache reuse is closed by the datagen stamp: manifests now record the
  generator binary hash, and a manifest with no binary stamp or a
  known-defective binary stamp regenerates instead of reusing the cache.
  Observed live: the pre-existing tpch SF0.1 cache without a stamp was
  discarded and rewritten stamped with the fixed darwin-arm64 dbgen hash.
- `results-data/corpus-inventory.json` is intentionally untouched: no bundle
  was added or removed here and trust labels are unchanged, so a regen would
  be a no-op diff.

## Local-engine regeneration

Cheap local cells are re-run with the fixed generator; each re-run lands as a
new bundle and the defective predecessor stays in place, labelled and
unranked. Status:

- tpch SF0.1 on SQLite: re-run started during the audit but produced no
  output in 90 minutes and was terminated; rerunning the cell (for
  example `benchbox run --platform sqlite --benchmark tpch --scale 0.1
  --non-interactive` with `BENCHBOX_OUTPUT_DIR=~/Developer/benchmark_runs`)
  is a follow-up. The stale cache was still discarded and regenerated
  with the fixed binary during the attempt (see cache note above). Fresh
  bundles are not ingested into the corpus by this change; ingesting
  replacements (new bundle files plus inventory update) is a follow-up
  per cell.

Remaining local/dataframe cells (79 bundles across 70 benchmark x platform x
scale cells) are follow-ups, cheapest first: SF0.01/SF0.1 SQLite, DuckDB,
DataFusion, Pandas and Polars across tpch, tpch_skew, tpchavoc,
read_primitives and datavault; then SF1.0 local cells; then the seven DuckDB
SF10 version-matrix medians, the Spark/PySpark SF0.01-SF1.0 cells, and the
single-host cells (CedarDB, ClickHouse Server, DuckLake, LakeSail, StarRocks).

## Paid cloud reruns (follow-ups, not run here)

61 cells need paid re-runs before their defective predecessors can be
superseded. tpch, tpch_skew and tpchavoc at SF0.1, SF1.0 and SF10 on each of
BigQuery, Databricks and Snowflake (27 cells); datavault at SF0.1, SF1.0 and
SF10 on Databricks and Snowflake plus SF0.01, SF0.1, SF1.0 and SF10 on
BigQuery (10 cells); read_primitives at SF0.01 and SF0.1 on all three
(6 cells); transaction_primitives and write_primitives at SF0.01, SF0.1 and
SF1.0 on all three (18 cells).

## Out of batch: TPC-DS Q85/Q93 scaling defect

The `scaling.dst` generator defect affecting TPC-DS Q85/Q93 is reported only.
Relabelling or regenerating TPC-DS data needs an owner decision and rebuilt
binaries first; no TPC-DS bundle is labelled by this change.
