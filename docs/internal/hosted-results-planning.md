# Hosted results: Phase 3 planning notes

Maintainer planning that accompanies `docs/reference/hosted-results-contract.md`.
The hosted API and self-service submission (Phase 3) are built only if Phase 2
pull-request volume exceeds maintainer capacity.

## Open questions (Phase 3)

The following questions are explicitly deferred to Phase 3 design and are not
resolved by this contract:

- **`public_result_id` collision resolution (Phase 3 only):** Concurrent mint
  strategy when two API submissions race to the same content-addressed id.
  Phase 1 static publication already fails closed on distinct content and
  skips identical content (see §1.1 and
  `docs/development/adr/adr-public-result-id-permanence.md`).
- **Idempotency semantics:** Re-submitting a bundle that is already in
  `pending` or `validated` state - return `200 OK` or `409 Conflict`?
- **Cross-visibility cohort comparisons:** Whether results in different
  visibility states (e.g., `private` and `public-curated`) may be included in
  the same compare cohort.
- **Private result access control model:** Submitter-only access, or
  organisation-based sharing (e.g., all members of the submitter's GitHub org)?
- **Ranking eligibility rules for mixed-visibility cohorts:** Whether a cohort
  containing both `public-self-reported` and `public-curated` results is
  eligible for ranked display, and which rules govern it.
