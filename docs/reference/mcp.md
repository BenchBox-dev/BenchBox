# MCP Server Reference

```{tags} reference, advanced
```

Complete reference for the BenchBox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, including all available tools, resources, and prompts.

## Running the Server

### Prerequisites

Install BenchBox with MCP dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra mcp
```

The MCP extra includes DuckDB because `duckdb` is the advertised local
execution platform in the MCP surface. Other platforms keep their separate
optional extras.

### Starting the Server

```bash
# Via Python module
uv run python -m benchbox.mcp

# Via entry point (if installed globally)
benchbox-mcp

# With explicit MCP path overrides
benchbox-mcp --results-dir /tmp/benchbox-results --charts-dir /tmp/benchbox-charts

# Opt in to localhost Streamable HTTP
benchbox-mcp --transport streamable-http
```

The default server communicates via stdio using JSON-RPC, compatible with
Claude Code and other local MCP clients. Streamable HTTP is an explicit
localhost-only option at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "benchbox": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Do not expose the unauthenticated localhost endpoint through a public bind,
port forward, or reverse proxy. Non-loopback binding requires a complete
`--security-config` policy. See [Remote MCP security and tenancy](../operations/mcp-remote-security.md)
for its threat model, token-digest provisioning, scopes, tenant workspaces,
shared admission store, and fail-closed proxy requirements. This capability is
not a production-readiness claim; keep shared endpoint publication disabled
until the [production-readiness gate](../operations/mcp-production-readiness.md)
has current evidence for the deployed revision.

### SDK Compatibility

BenchBox uses the Python MCP SDK 2.x `MCPServer` API and reports its own
`benchbox` server name and BenchBox package version during initialization.
The v2 migration preserves the public stdio contract: 12 tools, 4 static
resources, 2 resource templates, and 7 prompts. Tool names, input schemas,
annotations, resource URIs, prompt schemas, and handler behavior are unchanged;
only Python-side SDK model attributes use the v2 snake-case names.

An authenticated remote server adds four durable job tools. They use shared
storage and return immediately, so sessionless requests may reach different
workers without losing ownership or lifecycle state.

Streamable HTTP supports modern MCP `2026-07-28` as a sessionless protocol.
The only production-supported legacy handshake is `2025-11-25`; earlier
revisions are not covered by the acceptance matrix:
each request can reach any server process and no `Mcp-Session-Id` is issued.
The same endpoint retains the SDK's stateless compatibility path for supported
handshake-era clients. Protocol discovery, version negotiation, headers, and
DNS-rebinding checks are provided by the MCP SDK rather than reimplemented by
BenchBox. Responses remain streaming-capable; JSON-only mode is intentionally
disabled so progress and future request-scoped notifications remain possible.

### Testing Locally

To verify the server works, you can test it interactively:

```bash
# Start server and send a test request
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | uv run python -m benchbox.mcp
```

This should return a JSON response listing all available tools.

### Using the MCP Inspector

For interactive testing, use the pinned official
[MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector):

```bash
# Connect to an already-running localhost Streamable HTTP endpoint
npx --yes @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@2.0.0 --cli \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp --transport http --method tools/list --format json
```

The inspector provides a web UI to browse tools, test calls, and view responses.

### Server Options

`benchbox-mcp` supports explicit flags and environment-variable fallback.

**CLI flags**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--results-dir` | Results root used by MCP result reads/writes |
| `--charts-dir` | Charts root used by MCP visualization paths |
| `--log-level` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `--transport` | `stdio` (default) or opt-in `streamable-http` |
| `--host` | Streamable HTTP bind host; non-loopback requires `--security-config` (default `127.0.0.1`) |
| `--port` | Streamable HTTP bind port (default `8000`) |
| `--streamable-http-path` | Streamable HTTP endpoint path (default `/mcp`) |
| `--security-config` | Remote-only JSON policy for SDK auth, tenancy, authorization, admission, and audit |
| `--readiness-evidence` | Revision-bound evidence required for every non-loopback bind |

**Environment variables**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BENCHBOX_RESULTS_DIR` | `benchmark_runs/results` | Results root when `--results-dir` is not provided |
| `BENCHBOX_CHARTS_DIR` | `benchmark_runs/charts` | Charts root when `--charts-dir` is not provided |
| `BENCHBOX_OUTPUT_DIR` | `benchmark_runs` | Base root used to derive results/charts when specific vars are unset |
| `BENCHBOX_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level when `--log-level` is not provided |
| `BENCHBOX_BUILD_SHA` | none | Exact deployed revision matched by remote readiness evidence |
| `BENCHBOX_MCP_READINESS_SHA256` | none | Out-of-band digest of the readiness evidence file |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | none | Shared OTLP/HTTP trace endpoint required for remote publication |

Discovery and list responses carry a public five-minute cache hint. Resource
bodies, including recent results and system profiles, are always private and
immediately stale. BenchBox exports only bounded allow-listed MCP span fields;
tool arguments, result payloads, identities, authorization data, credentials,
and raw database URLs are excluded.

**Precedence**

1. Explicit MCP flag (`--results-dir`, `--charts-dir`, `--log-level`)
2. Specific env var (`BENCHBOX_RESULTS_DIR`, `BENCHBOX_CHARTS_DIR`, `BENCHBOX_LOG_LEVEL`)
3. Derived from `BENCHBOX_OUTPUT_DIR` for paths
4. Built-in defaults (`benchmark_runs/results`, `benchmark_runs/charts`, `INFO`)

Example:

```bash
BENCHBOX_RESULTS_DIR=/tmp/results BENCHBOX_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG benchbox-mcp
```

Additional localhost examples:

```bash
# IPv4 loopback with a custom port and path
benchbox-mcp --transport streamable-http --port 8765 --streamable-http-path /benchbox-mcp

# IPv6 loopback
benchbox-mcp --transport streamable-http --host ::1
```

## Tools

Tools are executable actions that can be invoked by AI assistants. BenchBox MCP
is a **beta-public scoped surface over the shared BenchBox engine**: all
benchmark business logic lives in `benchbox.core` below both CLI and MCP, and
each surface exposes a deliberately scoped subset of it. Surface asymmetry is
deliberate and ledgered, never a parity backlog. MCP must not import
`benchbox.cli` command internals. See
[ADR: One Engine, Scoped Surfaces](../development/adr/adr-one-engine-scoped-surfaces.md).

MCP run results are exported through `ResultExporter` as normal result JSON
bundles and include `execution_context.entry_point = "mcp"` when the result
object supports execution context metadata. Because both surfaces compute
results with the same core implementation, MCP numbers are comparable to CLI
numbers by construction; the bundles are schema-level comparable to CLI result
bundles.

### Actual Tool Inventory

| Tool | Category | Writes | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `list_available` | discovery | No | List platforms, benchmarks, chart templates, or all discovery data. |
| `get_benchmark_info` | discovery | No | Return benchmark metadata, queries, schema, and scale-factor information. |
| `system_profile` | discovery | No | Return CPU, memory, disk, Python, package, and BenchBox environment facts. |
| `check_dependencies` | discovery | No | Report platform dependency availability and install guidance. |
| `run_benchmark` | execution | Yes | Run, dry-run, or validate a benchmark through the MCP-scoped subset of the shared engine. |
| `get_query_details` | execution aid | No | Return SQL or DataFrame query details for a benchmark/query/platform. |
| `get_results` | results | Optional | List result files, read one result, or export a result in another format. |
| `analyze_results` | analytics | No | Compare result files, detect regressions, calculate trends, or aggregate runs. |
| `get_query_plan` | analytics | No | Read captured query plans from a result bundle. |
| `validate_results` | analytics | No | Validate result JSON integrity, completeness, and believability. |
| `suggest_charts` | visualization | No | Suggest useful chart types for one or more result files. |
| `generate_chart` | visualization | No | Generate ASCII chart output from result files. |

Authenticated remote mode additionally registers:

| Tool | Category | Writes | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `start_benchmark` | durable execution | Yes | Queue a tenant-owned benchmark and return an `execution_id`. |
| `get_benchmark_status` | durable execution | No | Read owned job state, attempts, cancellation, and timestamps. |
| `get_benchmark_result` | durable execution | No | Read the owned result after atomic publication. |
| `cancel_benchmark` | durable execution | Yes | Cancel queued work or request cancellation at the next safe worker boundary. |

### Run Surface Contract

`run_benchmark` remains the synchronous local-compatible execution tool.
Dry-run preview and configuration validation are modes on it (`dry_run=true`
and `validate_only=true`), not separate MCP tools. Authenticated remote clients
should use `start_benchmark` for a normal long-running execution; the durable
tool accepts the same normal-run fields plus an optional `idempotency_key`, but
does not expose `dry_run` or `validate_only`. In remote mode, a normal
`run_benchmark` call is rejected immediately; its `dry_run` and `validate_only`
modes remain available because they do not hold the request for execution.

**MCP run parameter schema**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `platform` | string | Yes | - | Target platform, for example `duckdb`, `snowflake`, or `polars-df`. |
| `benchmark` | string | Yes | - | Benchmark identifier, for example `tpch`, `tpcds`, or `joinorder`. |
| `scale_factor` | number | No | `0.01` | Data scale factor; benchmark-specific defaults and constraints may still apply. |
| `queries` | string or null | No | `null` | Comma-separated query IDs, for example `1,3,6`. |
| `phases` | string or null | No | `null` | Comma-separated phases; execution defaults to `load,power` when omitted. |
| `mode` | string or null | No | `null` | Execution mode: `sql`, `dataframe`, or `data_only`. |
| `capture_plans` | boolean | No | `false` | Capture query plans where the selected platform supports them. |
| `dry_run` | boolean | No | `false` | Preview the run plan without executing queries. |
| `validate_only` | boolean | No | `false` | Validate platform, benchmark, scale, and mode without executing. |
| `platform_options` | object or null | No | `null` | Typed, bounded, non-secret settings approved for the selected platform; credentials, endpoints, paths, and package-install controls are rejected. |

**Behavior**

- `validate_only=true` returns configuration validity, resolved execution mode,
  errors, and warnings.
- `dry_run=true` uses the core dry-run executor and returns the plan/resources
  preview the MCP subset can model; it currently reports the default
  load/power plan rather than applying the `phases` parameter.
- `mode=data_only` generates benchmark data without running queries. This is a
  deliberate, ratified asymmetry rather than a ledgered omission, and it runs
  the other way from the rest of the ledger: MCP accepts a value here that
  `benchbox run --mode` does not. `sql` and `dataframe` are platform
  *capabilities*, validated against
  `benchbox.core.constants.RUN_MODES`; `data_only` is an *execution type*
  (`benchbox.core.constants.EXECUTION_TYPES`), meaning "run no queries at all".
  The CLI derives that execution type from `--phases generate`, so it has no
  reason to name it on `--mode`. MCP's phase surface is a single string with no
  interactive selection behind it, so it names the execution type directly.
  `datagen` and `generate` remain accepted spellings of `data_only`. Both
  synchronous requests and durable workers route this execution through the
  shared core run service; MCP owns only the structured response envelope and
  tenant-scoped artifact path.
- `phases` is validated against
  `benchbox.core.constants.VALID_PHASES` at admission, on both `run_benchmark`
  and `start_benchmark`. An unknown phase is rejected with the valid list;
  previously it was accepted and then silently dropped, so a typo like
  `load,lodad` ran only the load phase without reporting anything.
- `phases` applies to normal execution and maps to the benchmark execution type
  used by `BaseBenchmark.run_with_platform()`.
- `platform_options` is normalized and validated before any adapter is built.
  The allow-list is intentionally narrower than the CLI's
  `--platform-option` surface: only bounded execution settings such as
  DuckDB `memory_limit`/`threads`, DataFusion partition settings, and selected
  DataFrame toggles are accepted. Unknown keys, credentials, DSNs, hosts,
  filesystem paths, unbounded values, and driver auto-install/version controls
  fail closed. Authenticated durable jobs persist only this normalized object,
  so retries and worker restarts cannot reintroduce raw request mappings.
- Velox `deployment` is not exposed over MCP. Local execution is the only deployment MCP can fully describe; `remote` would require an operator-approved endpoint (`sc://`) and additional packaging/runtime controls that are not part of the MCP allow-list. Both `remote` and `docker` are rejected at admission, so a request can never redirect execution to an endpoint it did not name via a server-owned profile. `docker` is rejected: the `docker/velox/` tree is packaging infrastructure for local development, not a deployment mode with its own lifecycle, endpoint, isolation, and cleanup contract. See the omission ledger below.
- Modin `engine` accepts only `ray` and `dask` over MCP. The adapter itself also
  supports `unidist`, which stays documented for CLI and Python-API callers but
  is deliberately outside the MCP surface while it is experimental. `pandas` is
  rejected everywhere: it resembles a valid Modin engine name but is not a
  supported BenchBox backend, and accepting it would create a public contract
  that fails late. A pre-set `MODIN_ENGINE` still takes precedence, but it is
  validated against the same reviewed set rather than trusted.
- DuckDB `threads` is the public option name and maps to the adapter's
  `thread_limit`, which becomes a `SET threads` statement on the connection. The
  public name is unchanged; only the internal mapping is documented here.
- Databricks clustering options are translated into effective tuning before the
  adapter is built. `databricks_clustering_strategy` and
  `liquid_clustering_columns` become a `PlatformOptimizationConfiguration` that
  the clustering resolver consumes; forwarding the raw names would leave them to
  be dropped by `from_config` and silently fall back to ZORDER. Contradictory
  combinations (for example `z_order` with liquid clustering columns) are
  rejected as validation errors at admission, before a durable job is persisted
  and before any remote connection.
- Dask cluster sizing is bounded in aggregate, not only per field. A request's
  `n_workers`, `n_workers` x `threads_per_worker`, and `n_workers` x
  `memory_limit` must all fit inside a server-owned budget, enforced before the
  adapter builds its `LocalCluster` (see
  [MCP remote security](../operations/mcp-remote-security.md)).
- ClickHouse connection destinations are server-owned. A request cannot set
  `port` or `secure`; both are rejected for every ClickHouse spelling. A
  non-default port or TLS setting is reachable only through
  `connection_profile`, which names a profile the operator defined in
  `BENCHBOX_MCP_CLICKHOUSE_PROFILES` (see
  [MCP remote security](../operations/mcp-remote-security.md)). Requests carry
  and persist only the profile name; the port and TLS policy are resolved from
  server configuration at execution time.
- The authoritative option-to-consumer, security-class, alias, and rejection
  matrix is maintained in
  `docs/development/mcp-platform-option-contract.md`. Every allow-listed key
  must have a matching matrix entry; a missing entry fails closed before
  adapter construction or durable-job persistence.
- Normal execution uses `BaseBenchmark.run_with_platform()` through public
  benchmark and adapter APIs.
- MCP execution intentionally suppresses console output and returns structured
  JSON for agent clients.
- Exported result bundles are anonymized when, and only when, the server runs
  under a remote security policy. Local stdio serves a same-trust-boundary agent
  that needs real paths and hostnames to act on results; a remote tenant is a
  different trust boundary, so `run_benchmark`, durable job publication, and
  `analyze_results` comparisons all export with anonymization enabled there.

**Scoped-surface omission ledger**

These `benchbox run` controls are not MCP parameters. Each entry carries exactly
one ratified tier reason, defined in
[ADR: One Engine, Scoped Surfaces](../development/adr/adr-one-engine-scoped-surfaces.md):

- **security-scoped** — permanent. Admitting the control would let a request
  name credentials, endpoints, filesystem or cloud destinations, or unbounded
  resources, or would trigger destructive or publishing side effects. Parity
  never applies to these. A bounded, typed, server-validated allow-list entry is
  a new narrow control, not a promotion of the CLI flag.
- **interaction-scoped** — permanent. The control governs terminal interaction
  or presentation and has no meaning in a structured request/response protocol.
- **not-yet-demanded** — provisional. Nothing about security or interaction
  blocks it; no MCP client has demanded it. Promotion is demand-driven and is
  recorded as a deferral on the `one-engine-parity-ledger` tracker item.

An omission that is absent from this ledger is a defect, not a decision.

### Per-Tool CLI↔MCP Mapping Ledger

Every local MCP tool names its CLI counterpart(s) or `none`. Every CLI command
family absent from MCP carries exactly one ratified tier tag. Together the two
tables below cover all 12 local tools and every CLI command family with no MCP
tool.

**MCP tool → CLI mapping (12 local tools)**

| MCP Tool | Category | CLI counterpart(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_available` | discovery | `benchbox platforms list`, `benchbox benchmarks list` | Discovery inventory. CLI lists are the authoritative registry read path; MCP exposes the same metadata via registry. |
| `get_benchmark_info` | discovery | `benchbox benchmarks list` | Single-benchmark metadata, query counts, and scale constraints. CLI `list` is the registry read path; MCP returns enriched per-ID detail via `get_benchmark_info`. |
| `system_profile` | discovery | `benchbox profile` | Host, CPU, memory, and package facts. |
| `check_dependencies` | discovery | `benchbox check-deps [platform]` | Dependency availability and install guidance. |
| `run_benchmark` | execution | `benchbox run` | Scoped subset of `benchbox run`; omission details are in the run-surface ledger below. |
| `get_query_details` | execution aid | `none` | MCP-only convenience: CLI users read query SQL from the benchmark source tree; MCP returns it structured per platform/mode. |
| `get_results` | results | `benchbox results`, `benchbox export` | Lists, reads, and exports result bundles; MCP inline-reads while CLI renders to stdout/files and supports cloud export. |
| `analyze_results` | analytics | `benchbox compare`, `benchbox report`, `benchbox aggregate` | Comparison, regression, trend, and aggregation over result bundles. |
| `get_query_plan` | analytics | `benchbox show-plan`, `benchbox compare-plans` | Reads captured plans from a result bundle; CLI also renders live plans. |
| `validate_results` | analytics | `_project/scripts/validate_results.py` | Result JSON integrity and believability checks (`benchbox validate` checks config YAML, not result bundles). |
| `suggest_charts` | visualization | `benchbox visualize` | Suggests semantic chart types for result files. |
| `generate_chart` | visualization | `benchbox visualize` | Generates ASCII charts; MCP is inline-only by contract, CLI may write files. |

**CLI command families with no MCP tool**

| CLI command family | Tier | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `benchbox auth` | security-scoped | Hosted credential provisioning and token lifecycle; MCP carries no credential-issuance surface. |
| `benchbox publish` | security-scoped | Publication writes to an external destination and assigns trust labels; MCP requests do not carry publish authority. |
| `benchbox submit` | security-scoped | Posts a result bundle to the hosted results platform; remote tenants must not submit on behalf of the server identity. |
| `benchbox setup` | security-scoped | Interactive credential and connection bootstrap that writes local config and touches filesystem/cloud state. |
| `benchbox shell` | interaction-scoped | Interactive SQL REPL; interaction has no meaning in a request/response protocol. |
| `benchbox datagen` | not-yet-demanded | Standalone data generation without a power run; MCP expresses this as `run_benchmark` with `mode=data_only`, so a separate datagen tool is not yet demanded. |
| `benchbox convert` | not-yet-demanded | Table-format conversion (e.g. parquet → delta); bounded enum, no MCP client has demanded it. |
| `benchbox tuning` | not-yet-demanded | Tuning template discovery and validation; promotion would be the enum subset (`tuned`/`notuning`/`auto`), not YAML paths. |
| `benchbox plan-history` | not-yet-demanded | Plan evolution history over multiple runs; bounded read, no client demand yet. |
| `benchbox download-answers` | security-scoped | Fetches external TPC answer keys from a remote source; network fetch with no tenant budget. |
| `benchbox metrics` | not-yet-demanded | QphH composite metric calculation; bounded, no MCP client has demanded it. |
| `benchbox config` / `benchbox validate` (config file) | not-yet-demanded | Config-file syntax and completeness check; file-path input outside the MCP result-registry surface. |

### Scoped-Surface Omission Ledger — `benchbox run` Flags

The section below ledgers every `benchbox run` flag not exposed as an
`run_benchmark` parameter. The tier taxonomy is shared with the per-tool ledger
above.

| CLI surface | MCP status | Tier | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--output` | Omitted | security-scoped | Result roots are server configuration (`--results-dir`, env vars). A request must not name a local or cloud write destination. |
| `--platform-option` | Narrow MCP subset | security-scoped | MCP accepts only its typed, non-secret allow-list; the full CLI key/value surface can carry credentials, DSNs, hosts, and paths. |
| `--benchmark-option` | Omitted | security-scoped | Unbounded key/value plumbing into benchmark internals has no typed, fail-closed admission model. |
| `--force` | Omitted | security-scoped | Forced regeneration and upload overwrite server-owned data outside the requesting tenant's lifecycle. |
| `--global-cache` | Omitted | security-scoped | Redirects writes to a shared `~/.benchbox/datagen/` root outside the server's configured result tree. |
| `--publish` | Omitted | security-scoped | Publication writes to an external destination; MCP requests do not carry publish authority. |
| `--publish-target` | Omitted | security-scoped | Names an external local or cloud destination (`s3://`, `gs://`, `abfss://`). |
| `--publish-label` | Omitted | security-scoped | Trust labelling is a maintainer attestation, not a request-supplied field. |
| `--non-interactive` | Omitted | interaction-scoped | MCP requests are non-interactive by protocol; interactive prompts are never issued, so the flag has no effect to expose. |
| `--no-progress` | Omitted | interaction-scoped | Progress bars are terminal presentation; MCP returns structured JSON. |
| `--quiet` | Omitted | interaction-scoped | Console verbosity control; MCP already suppresses console output. |
| `--verbose` | Omitted | interaction-scoped | Console verbosity control; MCP response detail is governed by tool schemas. |
| `--iterations` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Repeated power-test measurement is expressible over MCP; no client has demanded it. |
| `--seed` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | RNG seed for query parameter generation; bounded integer, no client demand yet. |
| `--official` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | TPC-compliant mode is a bounded boolean; it additionally requires `--seed`, so both promote together. |
| `--compression` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Bounded codec enum; no client demand yet. |
| `--table-format` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Bounded table-format spec; no client demand yet. |
| `--presort` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Bounded pre-sort enum; no client demand yet. |
| `--tuning` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Promotion must be enum-only (`tuned`, `notuning`, `auto`); the CLI's YAML-path spelling is security-scoped and stays CLI-only. |
| `--table-mode` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Bounded `native`/`external` enum; no client demand yet. |
| `--sorted-ingestion-*` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Bounded ingestion-ordering controls; no client demand yet. |
| `--validation` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | MCP exposes only the `validate_only` boolean; the validation-strictness enum is promotable. |
| Velox `deployment` (`remote`/`docker`) | Omitted | security-scoped | Remote Velox would require an operator-approved endpoint and runtime controls; only local Velox is exposed over MCP to avoid caller-controlled destination selection. |
| `--plan-config` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | MCP exposes only the `capture_plans` boolean; per-query plan-capture selection is promotable. |
| `--no-monitoring` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Metrics-collection toggle; bounded boolean, no client demand yet. |
| `--show-plans` | Omitted | interaction-scoped | Live plan display is terminal presentation; MCP returns structured results and captured plans through result tools. |
| `--normalize-plan-literals` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Plan normalization toggle is a bounded control with no client demand yet. |
| `--stats-per-table-timing` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Per-table timing detail is a bounded reporting control with no client demand yet. |
| `--strict-translation` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Strict SQL-translation behavior is a bounded execution control with no client demand yet. |
| `--ignore-memory-warnings` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Memory-warning handling is a bounded execution control with no client demand yet. |
| `--funding` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Funding metadata is a bounded provenance field with no client demand yet. |
| `--result-source` | Omitted | not-yet-demanded | Result-source selection is a bounded provenance control with no client demand yet. |

The textcharts MCP server remains a separate-client integration, not a bundled or proxied part of `benchbox-mcp`. See `docs/design/textcharts-mcp-boundary.md` for the accepted separate textcharts configuration and the rejected bundle/proxy alternatives.
### Discovery Tools

#### `list_available`

List platforms, benchmarks, chart templates, or all discovery data.
Benchmark rows include `support_status` from
`benchbox.core.benchmark_registry`; MCP does not maintain a separate support
classification.

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `category` | string | No | `all` | `platforms`, `benchmarks`, `charts`, or `all`. |

#### `get_benchmark_info`

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `benchmark` | string | Yes | - | Benchmark identifier. |

Returns benchmark metadata including `support_status`, category, query/schema
information, scale-factor constraints, and DataFrame capability.

#### `system_profile`

No parameters. Returns host and package information useful for capacity
planning.

#### `check_dependencies`

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `platform` | string or null | No | `null` | Specific platform to check; omitted checks all platforms. |

### Visualization Tools

BenchBox MCP visualization is result-aware semantic charting. `suggest_charts`
and `generate_chart` read BenchBox result files and accept semantic chart IDs
from `benchbox.core.visualization.chart_types`, such as `performance_bar`,
`power_bar`, and `query_heatmap`. These IDs are distinct from raw
`textcharts_*` primitive MCP tools. BenchBox does not register or proxy the
external `textcharts-mcp` server; if a client configures that server separately,
its tools remain a separate raw rendering namespace.
The `textcharts` Python package is an implementation dependency of BenchBox's
ASCII compatibility layer, not an MCP server registration. Running only
`benchbox-mcp` therefore publishes the result-aware tools listed below; a
client that intentionally configures a separate `textcharts-mcp` process sees
that server under its own namespace and must apply its own support and security
review.

#### `suggest_charts`

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `result_files` | string | Yes | - | Comma-separated result filenames. |

#### `generate_chart`

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `result_files` | string | Yes | - | Comma-separated result filenames. |
| `chart_type` | string | No | `performance_bar` | Chart type for single-chart output. |
| `template` | string or null | No | `null` | Template name for multi-chart output. |
| `output_dir` | string or null | No | `null` | Must remain `null`; MCP chart output is intentionally inline-only and caller-selected file paths are rejected. |
| `format` | string | No | `ascii` | Must be `ascii`; other formats are rejected until a tenant-scoped artifact contract is approved. |

Chart generation is intentionally inline-only. `generate_chart` returns the
ASCII content in the MCP response and does not create a caller-selected file.
This keeps chart output inside the response boundary while a future artifact
contract is designed for tenant ownership, path containment, overwrite and
retention semantics. Requests that set `output_dir` or choose another format
fail closed with a structured validation error.

Available `chart_type` values and template names are derived from the
visualization registries and are discoverable with `list_available(category="charts")`.

## Prompts

Prompts are reusable templates for AI analysis. Invoke via slash commands in Claude Code.
The same prompt catalog is available through both supported transports: use
`prompts/list` to discover the seven names and argument schemas, then
`prompts/get` with a prompt name and string-valued arguments to render one
prompt. Stdio and sessionless Streamable HTTP return the same prompt metadata
and rendered text; HTTP requests do not require or receive an `Mcp-Session-Id`.
The landing quickstart catalog references three of these prompts for guided
benchmark flows; the four remaining prompts are still first-class MCP prompts
and are discoverable at runtime.

## Resources

Resources provide read-only access to BenchBox data. Currently, resources are accessed indirectly through tools.

## Error Handling

All tools return structured error information:

```json
{
  "error": "Description of the error",
  "error_type": "ExceptionClassName",
  "suggestion": "How to resolve the issue"
}
```

Common error types:
- **ConfigurationError**: Invalid platform or benchmark configuration
- **DependencyError**: Missing required dependencies
- **FileNotFoundError**: Result file not found
