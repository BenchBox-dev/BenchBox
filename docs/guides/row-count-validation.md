# Row Count Validation

```{tags} intermediate, guide, validation

**Automatic validation of query results against expected row counts**

---

## Overview

Row count validation is a feature that automatically validates benchmark query execution by comparing actual row counts against expected results from official TPC answer files. This helps ensure:

- **Correctness**: Queries return the expected number of rows
- **Platform Compliance**: Database platforms implement TPC specifications correctly
- **Regression Detection**: Changes to data or queries don't break correctness
- **Confidence**: Results are trustworthy before performance comparisons

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

Row count validation is **automatically enabled** for supported benchmarks (TPC-H, TPC-DS) when using the standard adapters:

```python
from benchbox.platforms.duckdb import DuckDBAdapter
from benchbox import TPCH

adapter = DuckDBAdapter()
benchmark = TPCH(scale_factor=1.0)

results = adapter.run_benchmark(benchmark)

for query_result in results['queries']:
    print(f"Query {query_result['query_id']}: {query_result.get('row_count_validation_status', 'N/A')}")
```

Validation is enabled by default, and it runs automatically when the benchmark runs. The loop checks the validation status of each query result.

### Validation Output

Each query result includes validation metadata when validation is performed:

```python
{
    "query_id": "1",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "execution_time": 0.123,
    "rows_returned": 4,
    "expected_row_count": 4,
    "row_count_validation_status": "PASSED",
}
```

`expected_row_count` is the expected count from the answer files, and `row_count_validation_status` is the validation result. A real result contains other fields as well.

## Validation Statuses

### PASSED

Query returned the exact expected number of rows (or within acceptable range for non-deterministic queries).

```
✅ Query 1: 4 rows (expected: 4) - Validation PASSED
```

### FAILED

Query returned a different number of rows than expected. This indicates a potential correctness issue.

```
❌ Query 2: 250 rows (expected: 460) - Validation FAILED
  Difference: -210 rows (-45.7%)
```

**Possible causes:**
- Incorrect SQL query implementation
- Data loading errors
- Platform-specific behavior differences
- Scale factor mismatch

### SKIPPED

Validation was skipped because no expected result is available for this query/scale factor combination.

```
⚠️ Query 3: 150 rows - Validation SKIPPED
```

**Common reasons:**
- Scale factor other than 1.0 (expected results only available for SF=1.0 currently)
- Query variant not in answer files
- Answer files are unavailable and the provider reports `FileNotFoundError`,
  including a disabled download or an on-demand download that returned no files
  - run `benchbox download-answers` to pre-populate the cache
- Non-standard benchmark

### Missing Expectations and Provider Errors

`SKIPPED` means no row-count comparison was certified. Query execution can
remain `SUCCESS` while its `row_count_validation` block is `SKIPPED` and carries
a warning. An explicit SKIP expectation, an absent answer set or query lookup,
and a nonzero TPC reference stream use this unevaluated result.

A registered EXACT expectation whose count lookup returns `None` also becomes
SKIP with an `EXACT validation mode but no expected count available` warning.
This is the current defensive lookup behavior; it does not establish that the
returned rows are correct. Normal `ExpectedQueryResult` construction requires
an exact count or a formula for EXACT mode, so a constructor rejection is a
separate error, not this downgrade.

Expected-results failures are classified. A provider `FileNotFoundError` is
cached as absent answer data. The on-demand downloader currently converts its
failures to no files, which the loader reports as `FileNotFoundError`; those
failures therefore also become unevaluated skips. Other provider exceptions
produce a failed validation result and may retry on a later request. A waiter
timeout also fails validation while the background load continues. Neither an
invalid SKIP-mode result nor a provider timeout is published as normal SKIPPED
validation: the adapter records a failed query and validation error.

Canonical query-result serialization preserves expected/actual counts and
warning/error text. It downgrades PASSED evidence without an expected count to
SKIPPED. Consequently, a successfully evaluated RANGE check, whose result has
no single expected count, also appears as SKIPPED after this normalization.
Inspect the available evidence; execution success alone is not correctness
certification.

TPC-DS DataFrame runs use a separate validation boundary because their expected
row counts are not seed-aligned. Successful queries receive SKIPPED row-count
evidence and an UNCERTAIN validation summary; execution failures remain visible
as PARTIAL. SQL reference-stream validation does not certify those DataFrame
streams.

## Supported Benchmarks

### TPC-H

- **Scale Factors**: SF=1.0 (with fallback for scale-independent queries at other SFs)
- **Queries**: All 22 official TPC-H queries (Q1-Q22)
- **Query Variants**: Q15 variants supported (15a, 15b, etc.)
- **Scale-Independent Queries**: Q1 (same row count at any SF)

Expected results sourced from official TPC-H answer files distributed with dbgen.

### TPC-DS

- **Scale Factors**: SF=1.0 only
- **Queries**: All 99 official TPC-DS queries
- **Query Variants**: Base queries without substitution variants
- **Scale-Independent Queries**: None (all TPC-DS queries are scale-dependent)

Expected results sourced from official TPC-DS answer sets for SF=1.0.

## Advanced Usage

### Query ID Formats

The validation system handles various query ID formats automatically:

```python
validator.validate_query_result("tpch", 1, actual_row_count=4)
validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "1", actual_row_count=4)
validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "Q1", actual_row_count=4)
validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "query1", actual_row_count=4)

validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "15a", actual_row_count=1)
validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "Q15b", actual_row_count=1)
```

The first four calls all map to Query 1: an integer, a string, a `Q` prefix and a `query` prefix. The last two are query variants, which use the base query number and map to Q15.

### Manual Validation

You can validate query results manually using the `QueryValidator`:

```python
from benchbox.core.validation.query_validation import QueryValidator

validator = QueryValidator()

result = validator.validate_query_result(
    benchmark_type="tpch",
    query_id="1",
    actual_row_count=4,
    scale_factor=1.0
)

if result.is_valid:
    print(f"✅ Validation passed: {result.expected_row_count} rows")
else:
    print(f"❌ Validation failed: {result.error_message}")
```

### Scale Factor Handling

#### Scale Factor 1.0

Full validation support with exact expected row counts:

```python
results = adapter.run_benchmark(
    TPCH(scale_factor=1.0),
    validate_row_counts=True
)
```

At SF=1.0 all queries are validated. `validate_row_counts=True` is the default.

#### Other Scale Factors

**Scale-independent queries** (e.g., TPC-H Q1) use SF=1.0 expectations:

```python
validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "1", actual_row_count=4, scale_factor=10.0)

validator.validate_query_result("tpch", "2", actual_row_count=1000, scale_factor=10.0)
```

At SF=10, Q1 still validates because it is scale-independent. It uses the SF=1.0 expectation (4 rows) and the result is PASSED. Q2 is scale-dependent and there are no SF=10.0 expectations, so its validation is SKIPPED.

### Disabling Validation

If you need to disable validation:

```python
results = adapter.run_benchmark(benchmark)
```

There are two options. Option 1, disabling validation at the adapter level, is not yet implemented, because validation is always on. It may be added in a future version if needed. Option 2 is to ignore validation results by not checking the `row_count_validation_status` fields.

### Components

1. **QueryValidator**: Main validation engine
   - Normalizes query IDs (handles various formats)
   - Retrieves expected results from registry
   - Compares actual vs expected counts
   - Returns structured ValidationResult

2. **ExpectedResultsRegistry**: Centralized result storage
   - Lazy-loads expected results per benchmark/scale factor
   - Thread-safe caching for performance
   - Supports scale-independent query fallback
   - Provider pattern for extensibility

3. **Providers**: Benchmark-specific result loaders
   - `tpch_results.py`: Loads TPC-H expected results
   - `tpcds_results.py`: Loads TPC-DS expected results
   - Auto-registered on first validation

### Thread Safety

The validation system is thread-safe for concurrent query execution:

```python
results = adapter.run_throughput_test(
    benchmark=benchmark,
    num_streams=4
)
```

Throughput tests with concurrent queries are safe. `num_streams=4` runs 4 concurrent query streams, and each stream can validate concurrently without conflicts.

**Implementation:**
- Registry uses `threading.Lock` to protect cache and provider registry
- Double-check locking pattern for efficient concurrent access
- Slow provider loads happen outside locks

## Installation and Answer File Availability

### How Answer Files Are Distributed

TPC-H and TPC-DS answer files (~4.2 MB total) are distributed separately from
the BenchBox package:

| Installation method | Answer file availability |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `git clone` / `uv sync` (dev) | ✅ Included in `_sources/` |
| `pip install benchbox` (wheel) | ⬇️ Downloaded on-demand |
| `BENCHBOX_NO_DOWNLOAD=1` set | ⚠️ Skipped (validation disabled) |

For wheel installs, BenchBox automatically downloads a cached copy of the answer
files the first time validation is needed. Subsequent runs use the local cache
with no network overhead.

### Cache Location

Downloaded answer files are stored in:

```
$XDG_CACHE_HOME/benchbox/answers/    # if XDG_CACHE_HOME is set
~/.cache/benchbox/answers/            # otherwise (default)
```

Subdirectories:

```
~/.cache/benchbox/answers/
├── tpch/          # q1.out … q22.out
└── tpcds/         # 1.ans … 99.ans + NULLS variants
```

### Pre-Downloading Answer Files

To populate the cache before your first benchmark run (e.g., in a CI
environment without internet access during the run itself):

```bash
benchbox download-answers
benchbox download-answers --benchmark tpch
benchbox download-answers --benchmark tpcds
benchbox download-answers --force
benchbox download-answers --show-cache-dir
```

The commands download both TPC-H and TPC-DS answers, TPC-H only, TPC-DS only, re-download even if cached, and print the cache location and exit.

### Disabling Automatic Downloads

To opt out of all automatic downloads (air-gapped environments, CI pipelines
where networking is blocked):

```bash
export BENCHBOX_NO_DOWNLOAD=1
```

With this set, BenchBox skips the download attempt and logs an INFO message
instead of attempting a network connection. Validation is gracefully skipped for
queries whose answer files are not available locally; the benchmark still runs,
only correctness validation is omitted.

### Using a Custom Answer File URL

To serve answer files from a private CDN or internal mirror:

```bash
export BENCHBOX_ANSWERS_URL=https://your-cdn.example.com/benchbox/answers-v1
```

The downloader will fetch `tpch-answers.tar.gz`, `tpcds-answers.tar.gz`, and
`checksums.sha256` from this URL instead of the default GitHub releases URL.
See `.github/workflows/upload-answers.yml` for the expected archive layout.

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Failures at SF=1.0

**Symptom**: Queries fail validation at scale factor 1.0

**Possible causes:**

1. **Data loading error**
   ```
   # Verify data was loaded correctly
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lineitem;  -- Should match scale factor
   ```

2. **SQL translation issue**
   ```python
   sql = benchmark.get_query(query_id=1, dialect="duckdb")
   print(sql)
   ```

3. **Platform-specific behavior**
   ```
   # Some platforms may handle edge cases differently
   # Check if difference is consistent across queries
   ```

### Validation Skipped at SF≠1.0

**Symptom**: All validations skipped at SF=10, SF=100, etc.

**This is expected behavior:**
- Expected results are only available for SF=1.0
- Scale-dependent queries cannot be validated at other SFs
- Scale-independent queries (e.g., TPC-H Q1) still validate via fallback

**Solution**: If you need validation at higher SFs, use SF=1.0 for correctness validation, then higher SFs for performance testing.

### "No expected results provider registered"

**Symptom**: Warning message about missing provider

**Cause**: Provider auto-registration failed (rare)

**Solution**:
```python
from benchbox.core.expected_results import register_all_providers
register_all_providers()
```

This triggers provider registration manually.

### Query ID Not Found

**Symptom**: Validation skipped with "No expected row count defined"

**Causes:**
1. Query ID format not recognized
   - Use standard formats: 1, "1", "Q1", "query1"
2. Query variant not in answer files
   - Some TPC-DS query variants may not have answer sets
3. Non-standard query
   - Custom queries won't have expected results

## Technical Details

### Expected Result Models

```python
@dataclass
class ExpectedQueryResult:
    query_id: str
    scale_factor: float | None = None
    expected_row_count: int | None = None
    expected_row_count_min: int | None = None
    expected_row_count_max: int | None = None
    row_count_formula: str | None = None
    validation_mode: ValidationMode = ValidationMode.EXACT
    scale_independent: bool = False
    notes: str | None = None
```

`expected_row_count_min` and `expected_row_count_max` are for non-deterministic queries. `row_count_formula` holds an expression such as `"SF * 100"`.

### Validation Modes

1. **EXACT**: Row count must match exactly
   ```python
   expected_row_count = 4
   actual_row_count = 4
   actual_row_count = 5
   ```
   An actual count of 4 passes. An actual count of 5 fails.

2. **RANGE**: Row count must be within min/max range (for non-deterministic queries)
   ```python
   expected_row_count_min = 100
   expected_row_count_max = 150
   actual_row_count = 125
   actual_row_count = 200
   ```
   An actual count of 125 passes. An actual count of 200 fails.

3. **SKIP**: Validation is skipped. It is used when no expected result is available.

### Formula-Based Expectations (Future)

For scale-dependent queries, formulas can express expected count:

```python
ExpectedQueryResult(
    query_id="example",
    row_count_formula="SF * 1000",
    scale_independent=False
)
```

The formula scales with the scale factor.

Currently, only exact row counts are used. Formulas are evaluated using safe AST parsing (no `eval()`).

## Best Practices

### 1. Validate at SF=1.0 First

```python
correctness_results = adapter.run_benchmark(
    TPCH(scale_factor=1.0),
    validate_row_counts=True
)

assert all(q['row_count_validation_status'] == 'PASSED' for q in correctness_results['queries'])

performance_results = adapter.run_benchmark(
    TPCH(scale_factor=100),
    validate_row_counts=True
)
```

The first run establishes correctness at SF=1.0, and all queries should PASS. Then scale up for performance testing. Scale-independent queries still validate at the larger scale.

### 2. Check Validation Status in CI/CD

```python
results = adapter.run_benchmark(benchmark)

failed_validations = [
    q for q in results['queries']
    if q.get('row_count_validation_status') == 'FAILED'
]

if failed_validations:
    for q in failed_validations:
        print(f"❌ Query {q['query_id']}: {q.get('row_count_validation_error')}")
    raise AssertionError(f"{len(failed_validations)} queries failed validation")
```

Use this pattern in automated tests.

### 3. Document Validation Skips

```python
print("Running at SF=10.0:")
print("- Scale-independent queries: VALIDATED")
print("- Scale-dependent queries: SKIPPED (no SF=10.0 expectations)")
```

If you run at a scale factor other than 1.0, document that validation is limited.

### 4. Use Validation for Debugging

```python
if query_result['row_count_validation_status'] != 'PASSED':
    print(f"⚠️ Query may be incorrect - investigate before performance tuning")
    print(f"  Expected: {query_result['expected_row_count']} rows")
    print(f"  Actual: {query_result['rows_returned']} rows")
```

When you investigate performance issues, check correctness first.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to row count validation:

1. **Additional Scale Factors**: Expected results for SF=10, SF=100
2. **Custom Expectations**: Allow users to define expected results for custom benchmarks
3. **Result Content Validation**: Validate actual result values, not just row counts
4. **Checksum Validation**: MD5/SHA checksums of result sets
5. **Differential Validation**: Compare results across platforms
6. **Configuration Options**: Toggle validation on/off per query or benchmark

> **Note**: On-demand answer file download for wheel installs (item 7 from the
> original list) has been implemented. See the
> [Installation and Answer File Availability](#installation-and-answer-file-availability)
