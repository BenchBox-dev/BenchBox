# ADR: Split the public site into its own repository

## Status

Accepted 2026-10-06.

## Context

The Astro cutover was delayed by coupling to core CI: every site change ran the
full core pipeline, which also gated site deploys. The site
needs isolated CI and fast rollouts. This ADR moves every site asset out of
`BenchBox-dev/BenchBox` (core) into `BenchBox-dev/benchbox-site` (site),
connected by one versioned contract: the site-inputs bundle that core produces
and attests. benchbox.dev stays up, keeps its URLs, and keeps deploy receipts
and rollback throughout.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Where user docs live | Core. Docs change with code: about 20 core tests lock code against doc text, `README.md` has 26 relative `docs/` links, and `benchbox/utils/version.py:61` reads `docs/README.md`. The site gets docs through the bundle. |
| D2 | Repo | `BenchBox-dev/benchbox-site`, public, default branch `main`, squash-merge only. The owner creates it empty. |
| D3 | Rehearsal host | `next.benchbox.dev`; the owner adds the DNS record before the batch. A project Pages subpath breaks root-absolute links. |
| D4 | Deploy control plane | Replaced, not moved: a minimal Node plane in the site repo. The Python `site_deploy` package stays in core until the site removal deletes it. Corpus and snapshot checks become core attestations. |
| D5 | Docs PRs that break the site | Detected after merge. The site refuses the bundle, keeps the last good site and opens an issue in core. Core runs no Node build. An advisory pre-merge check is a follow-up. |
| D6 | Deploy trigger | Automatic on site `main` push and on each `core-bundle` dispatch; `workflow_dispatch` for rollback and redeploy. `github-pages` has no required reviewer and a deployment branch policy of `main` only. |
| D7 | Docs revision | Trunk only. `/docs/` and `/docs/dev/` both render from the newest certified develop bundle, as production does today. Supersedes ADR D13. Release-pinned docs are a follow-up. |
| D8 | Visual regression | Advisory on site PRs. The baseline is the currently deployed artifact. No approval variables. |
| D9 | Language rule | Source only: no `.py`, `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` in the site repo, and no `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.astro` or `package.json` in core. Third-party tools fetched at run time are allowed. Site hooks use lefthook, cspell and markdownlint-cli2. |
| D10 | `_blog/` | Moves to the site repo as `drafts/`. Each non-Markdown asset is re-evaluated: kept, deleted or ported to TS. Python never enters the site repo, including its history. |
| D11 | Sphinx retirement | At cutover. The rule that keeps the last Sphinx artifact redeployable is waived. Between cutover and the site removal, rollback is "move the domain back to core Pages"; after the removal, rollback uses site receipts. |
| D12 | Publication plane | The publication control plane retirement, including the GitHub clean-up (D18), is in this batch. |
| D13 | Runner pool | Measure first. Site receipts record queue time and merge-to-live latency; decide after a month. |
| D14 | Oracle review | Amended 2026-10-07. Soundness paths are never narrowed ahead of a deletion. C1 only *adds* `scripts/site_inputs.py` and `_project/scripts/explorer_pipeline/browser_fixtures.py` as soundness files. C2 removes the entries for the files it deletes, in the same commit, and keeps `prefix .github/workflows/`, `prefix publication/` and `prefix scripts/publication/`. Core PRs that touch soundness paths request the Codex connector; if it is unavailable, the owner posts the stand-in comment after the agent has dispositioned every blocking `oracle-review-shadow` finding on that head. |
| D15 | External links | A nightly lychee job in the site repo opens or updates one issue. It never blocks a deploy. |
| D16 | Bundle compatibility | `schema` is an integer major. Additive changes keep it; removals and renames bump it. The site supports N and N-1, proven by a CI matrix. Core lands a change first, the site second. |
| D17 | Ruleset edit | One hosted-ruleset change only: remove the `landing` required context from ruleset 15611785, right after the site removal merges. No other ruleset change. |
| D18 | Publication clean-up | Push the archive tag, record the before-state, then delete the `publication` branch, the `publication-attestation` environment and its secrets, and `PUBLICATION_APP_ID`/`PUBLICATION_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`. Uninstall the publication App if the API allows; otherwise the owner does. |
| D19 | First production deploy | The owner approves it live in chat during the production cutover pause. Later deploys are automatic. |
| D20 | Second external review | `agy` was out of quota. The owner first deferred it to the batch, then skipped it on 2026-10-07 after a second 429 (codex substitute declined). |

## Language rule

No Python source in the site repo, no JS/TS source in core. Run-time
third-party tools are allowed. The site-inputs bundle schema uses integer
majors; the site supports N and N-1 for one release; core lands first.

## Supersessions

- `_project/decisions/single-repo-migration.md`, in part: its A3 tree split
  places `landing/`, `website/` and `deploy/` on `main`. Those paths leave core
  under this ADR; the `main`-is-released-code rule is unchanged.
- `_project/decisions/adr-astro-unified-site.md` D12, D13 and D14, where they
  conflict: D12 plugs the site into the publication deploy plane (replaced by
  the bundle plus the Node plane); D13 describes the renderer cutover (done;
  this change cuts over repositories, not renderers); D14 overlaps
  comment-cleanup items with `astro-site-*` items (those items are folded by
  the tracker reconciliation).
- `docs/development/adr/adr-independent-publication-authorities.md`:
  superseded by this ADR for the site and deploy control-plane scope. Its
  corpus authority statements stay normative until the publication retirement
  re-homes them; that change applies the superseded marker.
  `scripts/check_decision_records.py` keeps enforcing the record set until then.

## Consumers appendix

Core tests that consume site behavior and therefore constrain the split. An
earlier count cited 35; verification at `d076a974d` found 40 direct consumers
(plus wiring-only references, excluded). The site removal re-points or deletes
each.

## Soundness scope (D14)

This ADR's companion change only adds to `.github/soundness-paths.txt`:

- `file scripts/site_inputs.py`, the attestation producer the site trusts;
- `file _project/scripts/explorer_pipeline/browser_fixtures.py`, the fixture
  producer the bundle carries.

Nothing is removed or narrowed: `prefix .github/workflows/`,
`prefix publication/` and `prefix scripts/publication/` stay as they are. The
narrowing moves to C2, in the same commit as the deletions.
