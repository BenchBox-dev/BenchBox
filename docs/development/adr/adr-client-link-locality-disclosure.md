# ADR: Client-to-Platform Locality Disclosure and Statement Overhead Probe

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-03
- Constrains: Result schema `environment.client_link`, CLI `--client-cloud` and `--client-region` options, post-benchmark statement overhead probe, Results Explorer read model v10, and hosted result submission validation.

## Context and Motivation

When benchmarking remote and cloud data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift, ClickHouse Cloud, or remote-backed DuckLake), measured query duration consists of two distinct components:

1. **Engine execution time** on the remote database or warehouse compute cluster; and
2. **Client-to-platform round-trip overhead**, including client serialization, network transport across cloud backbones or the public Internet, ingress gateway/proxy routing, and result set deserialization.

For long-running analytical queries (taking tens of seconds or minutes), network round-trip overhead is negligible. However, for interactive workloads, short queries, and smaller scale factors (e.g., SF0.01–SF1 power tests, metadata queries, point lookups, and lightweight aggregations executing under 100 milliseconds), client-to-platform latency can easily dominate the overall measured time.

A benchmark executed from an AWS EC2 instance in `us-east-1` against an AWS `us-east-1` Snowflake warehouse experiences ~1 ms of network latency. The exact same benchmark run against the same warehouse from a developer laptop over residential WiFi in Europe or South America experiences 50–150 ms of network latency per query. Across a 22-query sequence, this discrepancy introduces several seconds of non-engine latency.

Without client-link locality disclosure:

- Observers may misattribute network transit time to platform query engine performance.
- Results collected under vastly different network topologies are compared as if they were identical setups.
- Community and maintainer runs cannot be reliably reproduced without guessing client runner placement.

## Reconciliation with ADR Decision w12 (DuckLake)

BenchBox encountered a similar architectural challenge in ADR [`adr-ducklake-maturity-and-publishability.md`](adr-ducklake-maturity-and-publishability.md), where decision **w12** addressed whether DuckLake runs backed by remote S3 storage and PostgreSQL metadata catalogs could be published and ranked alongside runs on local NVMe disk:

> "The honest framing is that DuckLake's catalog backend and storage location are **part of the configuration under test**, exactly like a tuning profile or a scale factor — not a defect in the run.
>
> The real hazard is not publication, it is *comparison*: a DuckLake-on-S3 number partly measures object-store latency, so ranking it against DuckLake-on-local-disk as though they were the same system is the error. That is a comparison-grouping concern, addressed by recording the backing, not by suppressing the result."

The governing principle ratified in decision w12 is: **"Disclose the topology; do not infer the distance."**

BenchBox rejects attempting to mathematically adjust, subtract, or model network latency out of reported query timings. Latency subtraction is inherently speculative and risks masking engine-level stalls, connection teardowns, and driver inefficiencies. Instead, BenchBox discloses the empirical topology and network overhead directly:

1. **Disclose the client runner's location** (cloud provider and region).
2. **Measure the baseline statement round-trip floor** empirically via post-benchmark probes.
3. **Equip consumers and the Results Explorer** to group like-with-like topologies and flag cross-topology comparisons.

## Rejected Alternatives

### 1. Transport TCP Connect Probes and ICMP Pings

We rejected measuring network distance using ICMP `ping` or TCP SYN/ACK connection probes to target platform hostnames:

- **Ingress gateway and CDN distortion:** Modern managed data warehouses front compute clusters with multi-tenant API gateways, edge load balancers, CDN points-of-presence (e.g., Cloudflare, CloudFront), and Envoy proxies. An ICMP ping or TCP connect to `account.snowflakecomputing.com` or `bigquery.googleapis.com` terminates at the closest edge ingress proxy, which may be geographically near the client even when the backing compute warehouse is located across an ocean.
- **Protocol unrepresentativeness:** A TCP handshake does not traverse the application protocol stack (TLS session negotiation, HTTP/2 multiplexing, JDBC/ODBC session authentication, and database query dispatch). It fails to reflect the actual overhead experienced by database statements.
- **Network and permission restrictions:** ICMP is frequently disabled or filtered by cloud security groups, corporate firewalls, and container runtimes. Raw sockets require elevated privileges (`CAP_NET_RAW` or root), which BenchBox explicitly avoids requiring.
- **Internal / unmapped hostnames:** Cloud platforms often use dynamic, unmapped, or private endpoints inaccessible to standard network utility tools.

### 2. Named Qualitative Latency Bands (e.g., "local", "near", "metro", "cross-region")

We rejected categorizing runs into subjective latency bands:

- **Lossy and subjective:** Latency categories create arbitrary boundaries. For example, cloud cross-connects between AWS `us-east-1` (North Virginia) and GCP `us-east4` (Northern Virginia) often exhibit <2 ms latency, whereas two hosts in the same geographic metropolitan area over separate commercial ISPs may suffer >30 ms latency. Labeling cross-cloud as "cross-region" and same-metro as "near" is objectively inaccurate.
- **Maintenance fragility:** Cloud network backbones, direct connects, and peering agreements constantly evolve. Heuristic band assignments quickly become obsolete and invite endless debates over category boundaries.
- **Superiority of empirical data:** Storing objective facts (client cloud, client region, and measured statement overhead in milliseconds) provides ground truth that remains valid indefinitely.

## The Decision

We introduce `environment.client_link` as an optional nested metadata block in schema-v2 result bundles.

### 1. Schema Contract

```json
{
  "client_link": {
    "collection_status": "available",
    "source": "observed",
    "client_cloud": "aws",
    "client_region": "us-east-1",
    "statement_overhead_ms": {
      "samples": 5,
      "min": 1.42,
      "median": 1.68
    },
    "collection_error_class": null,
    "collection_error_message": null
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `collection_status` (`"available" | "partial" | "unavailable" | "error" | "not_requested"`): Overall collection outcome.
- `source` (`"observed" | "cli_option" | "unavailable"`): Origin of client cloud and region metadata.
- `client_cloud` (`string | null`): Cloud provider of the client runner (`"aws"`, `"gcp"`, `"azure"`).
- `client_region` (`string | null`): Cloud region identifier of the client runner (e.g., `"us-east-1"`, `"europe-west1"`).
- `statement_overhead_ms` (`object`): Empirical overhead measurements:
  - `samples` (`int`): Count of repeated probe executions (standard: `5`).
  - `min` (`float`): Minimum observed statement duration in milliseconds floor, representing the protocol and network baseline floor.
  - `median` (`float`): Median observed statement duration in milliseconds.
- `collection_error_class` (`string | null`): Name of error/exception class if collection failed.
- `collection_error_message` (`string | null`): Descriptive diagnostic error message if collection failed.

### 2. Client Locality Discovery (`observed` vs `cli_option`)

- **Automated IMDS Discovery (`observed`):** BenchBox attempts non-blocking, link-local discovery via standard cloud Instance Metadata Services:
  - AWS: IMDSv2 token request (`PUT http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token`) followed by document fetch (`GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document`).
  - GCP: Metadata fetch (`GET http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/zone`) with `Metadata-Flavor: Google`.
  - Azure: Instance metadata fetch (`GET http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/location?api-version=2021-02-01&format=text`) with `Metadata: true`.
  Discovery uses short timeouts (100–250 ms) to ensure that running on developer laptops or non-cloud servers terminates immediately without slowing startup.
- **CLI Overrides (`cli_option`):** When running in air-gapped environments, on bare-metal servers, or where IMDS access is disabled, submitters can provide `--client-cloud` and `--client-region` on the CLI. The result records `source: "cli_option"`.
- **Non-Cloud / Laptop Runs:** When IMDS is unreachable and no CLI override is provided, `client_cloud` and `client_region` remain `null`, and `source` is set to `"unavailable"`.
- **Known limits:** Container runtimes with IMDS hop-limit 1 and ECS/Fargate tasks (metadata at `169.254.170.2` / `$ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4`, not EC2 IMDS) fail closed to `unavailable`; attest with `--client-region` there. IMDS requests bypass proxies and only tight region tokens (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`) are accepted, so a middlebox error page can never become a published region.

### 3. Post-Benchmark Statement Overhead Probe (`statement_overhead_ms`)

- **Execution timing:** The overhead probe executes **post-benchmark**, immediately after all benchmark workload queries have finished and before database disconnection or container teardown.
- **No cache or timing contamination:** Executing post-benchmark ensures the probe queries never warm buffer caches, interfere with query stream sequencing, or affect benchmark timing measurements.
- **Protocol-level fidelity:** The probe executes 5 consecutive lightweight queries (typically `SELECT 1` or platform equivalent) through the active database adapter connection. This measures the complete round trip: client runtime → client driver serialization → network transport → server session parsing → execution → result retrieval.
- **Metrics:**
  - `min`: The lowest latency sample across the 5 iterations. This establishes the theoretical latency floor of the connection.
  - `median`: The median latency sample across the 5 iterations, capturing typical round-trip overhead.

### 4. Results Explorer Read Model v10

- Results Explorer read model v10 ingests `environment.client_link`.
- Locality disclosures appear as informative badges on result cards and benchmark detail views (e.g., `Client: AWS us-east-1 (1.4ms floor)`).
- Compare views evaluate client↔platform locality alignment:
  - When comparing runs with similar client-link characteristics, comparisons proceed normally.
  - When comparing a co-located run (e.g., intra-region cloud VM) against a high-overhead run (e.g., remote laptop over WAN), the comparison view displays an informative soft warning indicating that round-trip overhead differences may account for small query performance variance.

## Privacy & Anonymization Analysis

Locality disclosure must never compromise submitter privacy or leak infrastructure topology. We enforce strict boundary invariants:

1. **No IP addresses:** Neither public nor private (RFC 1918) IP addresses are ever collected, probed, or written into `client_link`.
2. **No hostnames or DNS records:** Machine hostnames, FQDNs, local network domain names, and database connection hostnames are excluded.
3. **No cloud resource identifiers:** Cloud instance IDs, MAC addresses, VPC IDs, subnet IDs, security group IDs, and cloud account/tenant IDs are strictly omitted from IMDS extraction.
4. **Machine ID isolation:** Host hardware identification remains confined to `environment.client_host.machine_id`, which is protected by BenchBox's salted SHA-256 anonymizer (`machine_<12hex>`).
5. **Macro-granularity only:** Locality is disclosed solely at the provider (`"aws"`, `"gcp"`, `"azure"`) and region level (`"us-east-1"`, `"eu-west-2"`). This granularity provides full topological transparency for benchmarking purposes without identifying individual VPCs or accounts.

All fields in `environment.client_link` are safe for public release in open repositories, adhering to the public contracts established in `docs/reference/public-contracts.md` and `docs/reference/hosted-results-contract.md`.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Full transparency for cloud data warehouse benchmarks: network round trips can no longer be confused with platform query execution speed.
  - Consistent adherence to ADR w12: topology is disclosed truthfully rather than estimated or suppressed.
  - Clean separation of concerns: post-benchmark probe guarantees benchmark integrity while providing accurate protocol-level overhead figures.
  - Privacy-preserving: zero leakage of IPs, hostnames, VPCs, or instance IDs.
- **Neutral:**
  - `environment.client_link` is optional and backward-compatible. Older bundles omitting this block remain valid schema-v2 results.
  - When IMDS is blocked or absent, collection degrades gracefully to `partial` or `unavailable` without interrupting benchmark execution.
